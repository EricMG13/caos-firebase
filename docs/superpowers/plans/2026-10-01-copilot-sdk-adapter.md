# Copilot SDK Adapter (with a Copilot CLI fallback) Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking. **The owner said "Do not use agents" on 2026-09-24: ask before dispatching any subagent; without a yes, execute inline with superpowers:executing-plans.**

**Goal:** Let a module of a governed run be answered by GitHub Copilot, behind the existing single model factory, on the machine the worker runs on (including an analyst's Windows PC). The Copilot SDK is the main transport and the Copilot CLI is a fallback, and every invariant the AI Gateway path holds stays unchanged.

**Architecture:** A model named `copilot:<model>[@<effort>]` or `copilot-cli:<model>[@<effort>]` makes `caos.models.chat_model` return `ChatCopilot`, a LangChain chat model. Each call runs one isolated Copilot session: no tools, no memory, no compaction. Both transports deliver the runtime's session events in the same wire form, and one mapping turns them into the `AIMessage` that `ChatCompletions` already prices, bounds and refuses. CAOS stays the orchestrator (LangGraph, the attempt ledger, the run's model pin), and Copilot is only the model. Lakebase keeps the queue, the ledger and the checkpoints, and the UC volume keeps the bytes. Only the worker process moves to the PC, where the Copilot seat is.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.13 · `github-copilot-sdk==1.0.16` (new, D77) · the IT-installed `copilot` CLI (fallback, D78) · LangChain core · psycopg on Lakebase · Databricks SDK (unchanged).

**Spec:** the **Design** section below, which extends spec §3 (`docs/rebuild/2026-09-22-caos-databricks-spec.md`: the one model factory, D7, D8) and D75 (a run is pinned to its model and price, `docs/rebuild/decisions.md`).

**Base:** `origin/rebuild/databricks`, where this plan merged as `dfd64ad` and the documentation was then brought in line with it (D77, B12, and the goal reissued as D76's addendum). The owner's local `rebuild/databricks` was 27 commits behind on 2026-10-01, so fetch first. Work happens in worktree branches, and the owner merges. The goal file `docs/rebuild/2026-09-22-goal.txt` runs this plan.

---

## Why this shape

- **What the workspace allows.** AI Gateway is disabled in the enterprise workspace; Lakebase, UC volumes and compute are enabled. GitHub Copilot is the AI layer the firm already approves, while RAI (the firm's gateway) needs use-case onboarding first.
- **What was rejected.** The proposed alternative was Copilot CLI as orchestrator, with one skill per module and Delta over ODBC. It would turn run order, exactly-once execution, the canonical envelope and anchored citations from code into instructions. This plan keeps CAOS in charge and swaps only the model transport, behind the seam that already exists: `CompletionProvider` → `ChatCompletions` → a LangChain `BaseChatModel`.
- **The worker can already move.** `python -m caos.graph.worker` runs as its own process: it polls Lakebase, claims runs by lease and writes under the lease. The API serves without it (with `CAOS_WORKER_IN_PROCESS` unset it reports `WORKERS_ABSENT` until a worker beats). The store (an SDK-minted Lakebase token) and the blobs (the SDK Files API) both work from a PC.
- **Why a CLI fallback.** The SDK pip package, or the runtime it downloads, may not be approved on a managed PC. The `copilot` binary IT already installed has a documented prompt mode that prints the same session events as JSON lines (`--output-format json`, added 2026; official changelog). The fallback is a transport chosen by name, not an automatic retry, for the reason in Design 10.

## Design (the spec this plan implements)

1. **Name grammar.** A Copilot model is `<platform>:<model>[@<effort>]`:
   - `<platform>` is `copilot` (the SDK) or `copilot-cli` (the CLI fallback);
   - `<model>` is the runtime's own id, matching `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9.-]{0,127}`;
   - `<effort>` is one of `low|medium|high|xhigh|max`.

   The effort is part of the name for a specific reason: when none is sent, the runtime silently applies the model's default effort, and no identity may name an effort the model did not receive (AR-15). A name that claims a Copilot platform and does not parse is refused `PROVIDER_NOT_CONFIGURED`; it is never read as an endpoint. The name flows unchanged through `CAOS_MODEL_ENDPOINT`, `CAOS_MODEL_PRICE`, `CAOS_MODEL_CHOICES`, the run pin (`runs.price_model`, migration 0043), the wire (`Id`, a length bound only) and `producer_identifier`, which allows `:`, `.`, `@` and `-`.
2. **Dispatch and identity.**
   - `chat_model(endpoint=name)` returns `ChatCopilot(model=name)` for a Copilot name, and `ChatDatabricks` otherwise.
   - `identity_of` returns `<platform>/<model>/<effort|none>/65536`, so a model served through Copilot qualifies separately from the same model on a gateway, and the CLI separately from the SDK (D8).
3. **SDK session posture.** Each call gets one `CopilotClient(mode="empty", base_directory=<fresh private temp dir>, log_level="none")` with one session, and the client, session and directory are all removed when the call ends. Empty mode turns off custom instructions, skills, memory, the session store, plugins, telemetry and environment context. The session sets:
   - `available_tools=[]`: no built-in, MCP or custom tool, so no shell, file or web access (invariant 1);
   - `system_message={"mode": "replace", "content": ""}`: the prompt is the whole request, as on the gateway;
   - `infinite_sessions={"enabled": False}`: otherwise on by default, and it would compact evidence;
   - `context_tier="long_context"`: the 1M-token tier, because CP-0 sends whole filings and the default tier is about 200K (D29);
   - `model_capabilities.limits.max_output_tokens = MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS`;
   - `streaming=False`.

   `response_format` is not sent: the canonical executor validates the envelope it asked for (invariant 9), and the request is still priced as though it carried it.
4. **One reply mapping for both transports.** A call's events (`{"type": ..., "data": {...}}`, camelCase fields, the runtime's own schema) become one `AIMessage`. A finish reason is stated only when the call was exactly the one asked for:
   - exactly one `assistant.usage` and one `assistant.message`;
   - the usage names the pinned model and the pinned effort;
   - it is not auto-routed, not BYOK, and offers no tools;
   - the message has no tool request and no server tool (a server tool can mean a second "advisor" model);
   - no truncation or compaction event occurred.

   Otherwise no finish reason is stated, and `ChatCompletions` bills the call and refuses it `PROVIDER_RESPONSE_INVALID` (F34). Finish reasons are read into the one vocabulary `provider.finish_refusal` knows: `end_turn` and `stop_sequence` become `stop`, `max_tokens` becomes `length`, and `refusal` becomes `content_filter`. Any other value passes through and is refused there.
5. **Charge.**
   - Usage tokens are input + cache read + cache write, all at the dated **input** rate, plus output at the **output** rate. The owner prices a Copilot model at `max(input, cache write)` per token. Summing may overstate cached reads, but the charge is never below GitHub's bill (1 AI credit = $0.01; GitHub publishes per-model dollar rates per 1M tokens).
   - A `copilot-cli:` request is priced and bounded with `CLI_OVERHEAD_BYTES` (64 KiB) added, because the CLI wraps the prompt in a system prompt of its own.
   - The bound `ChatCompletions._charge` applies stays: prompt tokens no more than request bytes, and output no more than `MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS`.
6. **Errors.**
   - A `session.error` is raised as `CopilotStatusError(OpenAIError)` carrying only its status, so `ChatCompletions` maps it the way it maps a gateway status: `NEVER_RETRIED` gives `PROVIDER_CALL_INVALID`, a 429 is re-sent under the same reservation, and anything else gives `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`.
   - A timeout aborts the session or kills the CLI and raises `TimeoutError`. That, a missing CLI, and a CLI exiting non-zero with no event are all indeterminate.
   - No error text travels. The CLI's stderr is never read.
7. **Readiness.** At start, the worker refuses `PROVIDER_NOT_CONFIGURED` (exit 2, before claiming any run) unless the following hold:
   - every `copilot:` model is offered to the GitHub identity signed in on this machine, is enabled by its organisation's policy, and is pinned at an effort it takes (or at none only if it takes none);
   - for any `copilot-cli:` model, a `copilot` executable is on `PATH`.

   The worker prints each SDK model's `max_prompt_tokens`. No runtime starts when no approved model is Copilot's.
8. **Where things run.** The worker runs on the PC, signed in to Copilot, with a Databricks CLI profile that reaches Lakebase and the volume. The API and UI stay wherever the hosting decision puts them (pending). The API and the worker must approve the same models, so that runs are pinned to Copilot models.
9. **Dependency.** `github-copilot-sdk==1.0.16` (MIT, released 2026-09-30). It brings `python-dateutil`, `pydantic>=2.11` and `httpx>=0.24`, all already locked. Its runtime comes from GitHub Releases, checked against the release's checksums. On the PC the runtime is provisioned once (`python -m copilot download-runtime`), and `COPILOT_SKIP_CLI_DOWNLOAD=1` stops any download at run time. `caos/copilot.py` imports the SDK only inside the SDK transport and readiness, so a PC that cannot install the package runs `uv sync --locked --no-install-package github-copilot-sdk` and uses `copilot-cli:` models.
10. **The CLI fallback (D78).**
    - **Invocation.** A `copilot-cli:` call runs the `copilot` executable found on `PATH` in prompt mode:
      - the prompt on **stdin**, because a module's prompt runs to megabytes, far past a Windows command line's 32,767 characters;
      - `--output-format json`, which prints the session events as JSON lines that the Design 4 mapping reads;
      - `--available-tools=` (no tool), `--no-custom-instructions`, `--no-auto-update`, `--stream off`, `--context long_context`, `--model` and `--reasoning-effort`.
    - **Isolation.** It runs with a private `COPILOT_HOME` that doubles as its working directory and is removed afterwards, so none of the analyst's extensions, skills, plugins, MCP configuration, memory or trusted folders reaches the call. The `GITHUB_COPILOT_PROMPT_MODE_*` opt-ins are never passed on.
    - **Chosen by name only.** It is never an automatic fallback, for two reasons. No CLI flag replaces Copilot's own system prompt, so its answers are a different execution profile. And a run pinned to one transport never switches (F468).
    - **Process start.** The CLI is started with `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`. Bandit's subprocess checks do not cover asyncio's process API (verified on 2026-10-01: zero findings for that call). The call therefore carries no finding and needs no suppression. To make up for the scanner's blind spot, its arguments are fixed flags plus a model id matched against `[a-z0-9.-]` (never the prompt), it uses no shell, and Task 4 requires an adversarial review.
    - **Known gap.** The CLI caps output at the model's own limit, not `MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS`. An answer past 65,536 tokens is billed as unknown and refused, as it would be on the gateway.

## Gating risks (Task 1 measures them before any code)

| Risk | Why it matters | Stop rule |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt limit | D29 sized requests for a 1M-token model; CP-0 sends whole filings (a 1.92 MB 10-K went in one request). Copilot's default tier is about 200K, and its 1M tier is selected per session. | Record each candidate's `max_prompt_tokens` under `long_context`. If a candidate rejects the tier, record it; the owner decides. |
| Auth in isolation | Empty mode does not fall back to `~/.copilot`, and the CLI runs under a fresh `COPILOT_HOME`. A signed-in user may not be visible to either. | If neither the signed-in user nor `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` authenticates a transport, stop and report. |
| Empty replaced system message (SDK) | GitHub warns that replace "removes guardrails", and firm policy may forbid it. | If refused, stop and report (owner decides). |
| Usage semantics | The charge assumes reasoning tokens are inside `outputTokens`. | Any `reasoningTokens > outputTokens`: stop. |
| Hidden prompt overhead | Prompt tokens may not exceed request bytes. | SDK smoke `inputTokens` > 160: stop. CLI smoke `inputTokens` > 32,768 (half the 64 KiB allowance): stop. |
| One call per prompt | The mapping refuses two `assistant.usage` events, and prompt mode may make auxiliary calls (for example, titles). | More than one `assistant.usage` on a plain smoke, on either transport: stop and report. |
| CLI JSON lines | The fallback reads `assistant.usage` from stdout. | If stdout lacks `assistant.usage` with `inputTokens` and `outputTokens`: stop. |
| CLI flags | `_CLI_FLAGS` uses spellings from the changelog. | Record `copilot --help`; correct `_CLI_FLAGS` to its spelling in Task 4. If no spelling offers no tools (`availableToolCount` 0), stop. |

## Global Constraints

- Python `>=3.13,<3.14`. Use `uv run` for every tool. No `requirements.txt`.
- All gates exit 0 and none is loosened (project `CLAUDE.md`).
  - Per task: `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run ruff format --check .`, `uv run mypy caos scripts tests`, and the task's tests.
  - Before each PR: the full gate list in `CLAUDE.md`, including:
    - `CAOS_REQUIRE_POSTGRES=1 uv run pytest -n auto -m "not live_provider"` (coverage ≥ 80%);
    - `scripts/check_tested.py`, `scripts/check_vocabulary.py`, `scripts/check_gate_config.py`;
    - complexipy ≤ 15, `jscpd --threshold 3`, `pip-audit --strict`, bandit with the floor, `uv lock --check`.
- Ruff selects `ANN` (no bare `Any` on arguments: use `object` for `**kwargs`), `BLE` (no blind `except`), `TRY`, `C901` ≤ 10 and `PLR0913` ≤ 5 arguments. mypy is strict.
- Add no new suppression (`noqa`, `type: ignore`, `nosec`, `pragma`): `tests/gate_baseline.json` may only fall. Bandit fails on any finding (`scripts/scan_floors.py`).
- Every module-level public function and class is named by a test that imports it from its own module (`scripts/check_tested.py`).
- One term per concept (`CONTEXT.md`). Never use `pipeline`, `workflow`, `chunk`, `fragment`, `passage`, `corpus`, `deal`, `benchmark`, `golden_set` or `ready_set` in identifiers.
- Typed refusals only. Never `str(exc)`. Never print or log a prompt, an answer, an error message, the CLI's stderr, a path under a user's home, or a credential. A model name, a count and a status code are host facts.
- Money is `Decimal`, never `float` (invariant 7). No model call without a reservation (invariant 8).
- A new dependency needs a `Dn` entry in `docs/rebuild/decisions.md` (D77 here).
- IDs: **D77** (the direction) and **B12** (the gateway disabled) were recorded when the build was initialised on 2026-10-01; Task 2 adds "D77, addendum". Still free: **D78, D79, N121–N125, B13**. Another session may take some meanwhile, so re-read the tail of each log before writing.
- PRs stay ≤ 800 changed lines (`docs/**`, `vendor/**` and lockfiles excluded; check with `uv run python scripts/check_pr_size.py <base>`). Ship three stacked PRs:
  - **Copilot 1/3**, the SDK transport (Tasks 2–3);
  - **Copilot 2/3**, the CLI fallback (Task 4);
  - **Copilot 3/3**, the worker on the PC (Tasks 5–7).
- Task 4's review is adversarial and security-focused: the `adversarial-reviewer` skill inline, or `mx-adversary` if the owner allows agents. The reason is that bandit does not scan its process start.
- Make paid calls (Task 1, Task 7) only within an amount the owner authorises for that task, in chat or in the goal's VALUES line (`docs/rebuild/2026-09-22-goal.txt`, default none). Copilot bills AI credits at $0.01 each.
- End every commit message with the session's attribution trailer.

### Task 1: Measure the Copilot runtime and CLI (spike; no repository code)

**Files:**
- Create (git-ignored): `docs/rebuild/runs/copilot-spike-<YYYY-MM-DD>/copilot_spike.py`, `facts.jsonl`, `help.txt`, `SUMMARY.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing.
- Produces: `SUMMARY.md`, which D77 and D78 cite. It records the exact model ids, the auth method that works for each transport, each model's prompt limit and prices, the CLI flag spellings and the CLI overhead tokens.

Run it on the machine the worker will run on (the analyst PC), because model policy and auth are the firm's. Any machine with a Copilot seat can pre-check the mechanics. **Spend:** about 15 small calls plus two 200 KB prompts on the cheapest listed model. Ask the owner for **$1.00** of Copilot credits before Step 3.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the spike script**

- [ ] **Step 2: List what this identity is offered, and the CLI's flags (free)**

Sign in first by running the IT-installed CLI once (`copilot`, then `/login`). Then run, with `S=docs/rebuild/runs/copilot-spike-<date>`:

```bash
uv run python $S/copilot_spike.py list | tee -a $S/facts.jsonl
copilot --version > $S/help.txt && copilot --help >> $S/help.txt
```

- Expected output: `{"auth": true, ...}` followed by one line per model.
- If `auth` is false, set `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` (a fine-grained token with the "Copilot Requests" permission) in this shell and run again. Record which method worked; Task 7's runbook keeps only that one.
- In `help.txt`, find the spellings for:
  - the JSON output format;
  - offering no tools (`--available-tools=` or similar);
  - `--no-custom-instructions`, `--no-auto-update`, `--stream` and `--reasoning-effort`;
  - the context tier (`--context` and its values).

  Write them into `SUMMARY.md`.

- [ ] **Step 3: One smoke call per candidate, per transport (owner-authorised spend)**

The candidates are the cheapest listed GPT-6 Luna id, Claude Sonnet 5.5, and Claude Opus 5.5 at the effort the owner wants, using the exact ids from Step 2. Replace the CLI flags below with Step 2's spellings:

```bash
uv run python $S/copilot_spike.py sdk <luna-id> | tee -a $S/facts.jsonl
uv run python $S/copilot_spike.py sdk <opus-id> high | tee -a $S/facts.jsonl
uv run python $S/copilot_spike.py cli <luna-id> none -- \
  --output-format json --available-tools= --no-custom-instructions --no-auto-update \
  --stream off --context long_context | tee -a $S/facts.jsonl
uv run python $S/copilot_spike.py cli <opus-id> high -- \
  --output-format json --available-tools= --no-custom-instructions --no-auto-update \
  --stream off --context long_context | tee -a $S/facts.jsonl
```

Expected for every call:
- exactly one `usage` line, whose `model` equals the id asked for;
- `isAuto` false or null, and `reasoningEffort` equal to the effort sent;
- `availableToolCount` 0 or null;
- `reasoningTokens` null or ≤ `outputTokens`;
- `toolRequests` and `serverTools` false.

Per transport:
- SDK: `inputTokens` ≤ 160, and `maxOutputTokens` 65536 (or the model's own lower cap, recorded).
- CLI: exit 0; record `inputTokens`, which is the CLI's own overhead.

Apply the stop rules in **Gating risks**. If the CLI's `assistant.usage` is missing from stdout, stop: the fallback has nothing to bill from.

- [ ] **Step 4: Cache semantics and the over-limit behaviour (cheapest model, SDK)**

```bash
uv run python $S/copilot_spike.py sdk-fill <luna-id> 200000 | tee -a $S/facts.jsonl
uv run python $S/copilot_spike.py sdk-fill <luna-id> 200000 | tee -a $S/facts.jsonl
uv run python $S/copilot_spike.py sdk-fill <luna-id> <5 × its max_prompt_tokens> | tee -a $S/facts.jsonl
```

Record:
- whether the second call reports `cacheReadTokens > 0`, and whether `inputTokens` already includes them (the D77 sum rule is conservative either way);
- whether the over-limit prompt gets an `error` with `statusCode` 400 or 413 (not billed), or a truncation event (billed). The adapter refuses both; the runbook states which happens.

- [ ] **Step 5: Summarise**

In `SUMMARY.md`, add:
- one line per gating risk (the value measured and the verdict);
- the auth method that works per transport;
- each candidate's id, `max_prompt_tokens` under `long_context`, efforts and per-token prices;
- the CLI flag spellings;
- the CLI overhead tokens.

Nothing is committed, because the folder is git-ignored.

### Task 2: The names and the shared reply mapping

**Files:**
- Create: `caos/copilot.py`, `tests/test_copilot.py`
- Modify: `pyproject.toml` (dependencies), `uv.lock`, `docs/rebuild/decisions.md` (D77)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `caos.provider.TIMEOUT_SECONDS`; `caos.refusals.Refusal`, `RefusalCode`. No SDK import.
- Produces (later tasks rely on these exact names):
  - `PLATFORM = "copilot"`;
  - `Event = Mapping[str, Any]`, one session event in wire form;
  - `@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True) class CopilotModel: platform: str; name: str; reasoning_effort: str | None`;
  - `def parsed(model: str) -> CopilotModel | None`, which raises `Refusal(PROVIDER_NOT_CONFIGURED)` on a malformed Copilot name;
  - `class CopilotStatusError(OpenAIError)` with `.status_code: int | None`;
  - `Ask = Callable[[str, CopilotModel, float], Sequence[Event]]`;
  - `class ChatCopilot(BaseChatModel)` with `model: str`, `timeout: float = TIMEOUT_SECONDS` and `ask: Any = None`;
  - `def reply_message(seen: Sequence[Event], target: CopilotModel) -> AIMessage`;
  - `def _data(seen: Sequence[Event], kind: str) -> list[Mapping[str, Any]]` (private; Task 4 uses it);
  - `def ask_copilot(prompt: str, target: CopilotModel, seconds: float) -> list[Event]`, a stub raising `NotImplementedError` that Task 3 implements in the same PR.

- [ ] **Step 1: Check the dependency (already locked)**

`github-copilot-sdk==1.0.16` was added to `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` when the build was initialised (D77, addendum: dependency), with the documentation, so the build starts from a lock `pip-audit` has cleared (F474). Do not edit either file.

Run: `uv run python -c "import copilot; print('sdk ok')"`

Expected: `sdk ok`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing tests**

Create `tests/test_copilot.py`:

```python

shared reply mapping, the transports and `ChatCopilot` through

"""GitHub Copilot as the model behind the one factory (D77).

AI Gateway is disabled in the enterprise workspace, so a model named
`copilot:<model>[@<effort>]` is answered by the GitHub Copilot runtime through
the Copilot SDK, on the machine the worker runs on and under the GitHub
identity signed in there; no credential is read by this code. The runtime is
used as a model and as nothing else.

Whatever transport carries a call, its answer arrives as the runtime's session
events in their wire form, `{"type": ..., "data": {...}}`, and is shaped here
into the `AIMessage` `models.ChatCompletions` already prices, bounds and
refuses, so every rule the gateway path is held to holds unchanged: the charge
is tokens x the run's dated price (invariant 7), a finish reason other than
`stop` is a refusal carrying its bill, one deadline bounds the call, and no
text of an error travels. A finish reason is stated only when the call was
exactly the one asked for; any other call is billed and refused as an invalid
response (F34).

def ask_copilot(prompt: str, target: CopilotModel, seconds: float) -> list[Event]:

    raise NotImplementedError
```

The `ask_copilot` stub only exists so that `ChatCopilot` type-checks. Task 3 replaces it in the same PR, and `chat_model` does not dispatch until Task 3.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests to verify they pass**

Run: `uv run pytest --no-cov -p no:xdist tests/test_copilot.py -q`
Expected: all pass.

Run: `uv run ruff check caos/copilot.py tests/test_copilot.py && uv run ruff format --check caos/copilot.py tests/test_copilot.py && uv run mypy caos scripts tests`
Expected: clean. If `ruff format` would reflow, run `uv run ruff format` on the two files and re-run.

- [ ] **Step 6: Record D77's addendum**

D77 (the direction) was recorded when the build was initialised. Re-read the tail of `docs/rebuild/decisions.md`, then append this under D77's section `## GitHub Copilot as the model, 2026-10-01`:

```markdown
- D77, addendum (<YYYY-MM-DD>) — The SDK transport as built. A model named `copilot:<model>[@<effort>]` (`caos/copilot.py`) is answered by the Copilot runtime through `github-copilot-sdk` 1.0.16 on the machine the worker runs on: `caos.models.chat_model` returns `ChatCopilot` for such a name, and `ChatCompletions` prices, bounds and refuses its answer exactly as a gateway answer, so CAOS stays the orchestrator and Copilot is only the model. Each call is one empty-mode client, session and private directory, all removed afterwards: no tool (`available_tools=[]`, invariant 1); no custom instruction, skill or memory; the system message replaced by nothing; infinite sessions off (nothing compacted); the long-context tier (CP-0 sends whole filings, D29); output capped at `MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS`; `response_format` not sent (the executor validates the envelope, invariant 9). Answers are read from the runtime's session events in wire form, so any transport that delivers them shares one mapping: a finish reason is stated only for exactly one model call on the pinned model at the pinned effort, offered no tool, with no tool request, no server tool and nothing truncated or compacted; anything else is billed and refused as an invalid response (F34). The charge is every prompt token (input, cache read, cache write) at the dated input rate plus output at the output rate; the owner prices a Copilot model at max(input, cache write) per token, so the charge is never below GitHub's bill (1 AI credit = $0.01). The effort is part of the name because the runtime applies a model's default effort when none is sent (AR-15). The identity is `copilot/<model>/<effort|none>/65536`, so a Copilot-served model qualifies separately from the same model on a gateway. Alternatives: Copilot CLI as the orchestrator with one skill per module and Delta over ODBC (run order, the ledger, the envelope and citations would rest on instructions, not code; rejected); a `CompletionProvider` of its own (duplicates the deadline, charge and refusal logic `ChatCompletions` already proves); RAI (needs use-case onboarding; a later provider behind the same factory). Measured first: `docs/rebuild/runs/copilot-spike-<date>/SUMMARY.md` (git-ignored). Evidence: `tests/test_copilot.py`.
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add pyproject.toml uv.lock caos/copilot.py tests/test_copilot.py docs/rebuild/decisions.md
git commit -m "Copilot 1/3: the copilot: names and the shared reply mapping (D77)"
```

### Task 3: The SDK transport and the factory dispatch

**Files:**
- Modify: `caos/copilot.py` (replace the `ask_copilot` stub; add `session_options`, `_client`, `_asked`)
- Modify: `caos/models.py:1-17` (docstring), `caos/models.py:80-110` (`identity_of`, `chat_model`)
- Modify: `caos/provider.py:1-14` (docstring)
- Test: `tests/test_copilot.py` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 2's names; `caos.provider.MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS`; the SDK's `CopilotClient`, `ModelCapabilitiesOverride`, `ModelLimitsOverride` and `SessionEvent`, imported only inside the functions that use them.
- Produces:
  - `def session_options(target: CopilotModel, home: str) -> dict[str, Any]`;
  - `def ask_copilot(prompt: str, target: CopilotModel, seconds: float) -> list[Event]` (real);
  - `async def _client() -> AsyncIterator[tuple[CopilotClient, str]]` (private; Task 5 reuses it);
  - `caos.models.identity_of(model, reasoning_effort=None) -> str`, now aware of the platform;
  - `caos.models.chat_model(*, endpoint=None) -> BaseChatModel`, now `ChatCopilot` for a Copilot name.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Merge these imports into `tests/test_copilot.py`'s import block, in `ruff` order:

```python

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to verify they fail**

Run: `uv run pytest --no-cov -p no:xdist tests/test_copilot.py -q`
Expected: an `ImportError` for `session_options`. After a stub of it exists, the failures are the `NotImplementedError`, `ChatDatabricks` being reached for a Copilot name, and the identity mismatch.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the SDK transport**

In `caos/copilot.py`, merge into the imports:

```python
import asyncio
import tempfile
from collections.abc import AsyncIterator
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

from caos.provider import MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from copilot import CopilotClient, SessionEvent
```

(`MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS` joins the existing `caos.provider` import line.) Replace the `ask_copilot` stub with:

```python
# The events that end a call: the session went idle, or it failed.
_ENDS = frozenset({"session.idle", "session.error"})


def session_options(target: CopilotModel, home: str) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """What one session is created with: the pinned model at its pinned effort,
    and nothing else the runtime offers (D77)."""
    from copilot import ModelCapabilitiesOverride, ModelLimitsOverride

    return {
        "model": target.name,
        "reasoning_effort": target.reasoning_effort,
        # A model, not an agent: no tool of any source -- built-in, MCP or
        # custom -- so no file, shell or web page is reachable (invariant 1).
        "available_tools": [],
        # The prompt is the whole request, as it is on the gateway.
        "system_message": {"mode": "replace", "content": ""},
        # Never compacted to fit: evidence is sent whole or refused.
        "infinite_sessions": {"enabled": False},
        # The 1M-token tier: CP-0 sends whole filings (D29).
        "context_tier": "long_context",
        # The completion cap every reservation is priced on.
        "model_capabilities": ModelCapabilitiesOverride(
            limits=ModelLimitsOverride(max_output_tokens=MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS)
        ),
        "working_directory": home,
        "streaming": False,
    }


@asynccontextmanager
async def _client() -> AsyncIterator[tuple[CopilotClient, str]]:
    """One runtime in a private directory removed with it, so a prompt -- which
    carries document text -- is not left on the disk after its call (D77)."""
    from copilot import CopilotClient

    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory(
        prefix="caos-copilot-", ignore_cleanup_errors=True
    ) as home:
        async with CopilotClient(
            mode="empty", base_directory=home, log_level="none"
        ) as client:
            yield client, home


def ask_copilot(prompt: str, target: CopilotModel, seconds: float) -> list[Event]:
    """One call through the SDK: every event, in its wire form and order.

    Raises `TimeoutError` past `seconds`, having asked the runtime to stop;
    whatever else the SDK raises propagates, and `ChatCompletions` reads it as
    indeterminate. A session error ends the wait and is returned as data, so
    its message is never raised.
    """
    return asyncio.run(_asked(prompt, target, seconds))


async def _asked(prompt: str, target: CopilotModel, seconds: float) -> list[Event]:
    seen: list[Event] = []
    ended = asyncio.Event()

    def heard(event: SessionEvent) -> None:
        wire = event.to_dict()
        seen.append(wire)
        if wire.get("type") in _ENDS and wire.get("agentId") is None:
            ended.set()

    async with _client() as (client, home):
        options = session_options(target, home)
        async with await client.create_session(**options) as session:
            session.on(heard)
            await session.send(prompt)
            try:
                await asyncio.wait_for(ended.wait(), timeout=seconds)
            except TimeoutError:
                await session.abort()
                raise
    return seen
```

`asyncio.run` gives each call its own event loop, on the thread `ChatCompletions._invoked` runs it on. That thread is abandoned at the call's deadline (ST-9), the same way the gateway's socket is.

- [ ] **Step 4: Dispatch in the factory**

In `caos/models.py`, add `from caos import copilot` after `from caos.pricing import ...`, then replace `identity_of`:

```python
def identity_of(model: str, reasoning_effort: str | None = None) -> str:
    """The execution profile a verdict binds (D8), from the names alone, so a
    caller can refuse an unexpected one before any client is built. A Copilot
    model names its own platform and effort (D77)."""
    target = copilot.parsed(model)
    if target is None:
        parts = (PLATFORM, model, reasoning_effort or "none")
    else:
        parts = (target.platform, target.name, target.reasoning_effort or "none")
    return "/".join((*parts, str(MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS)))
```

In `chat_model`, dispatch before the `databricks_langchain` import, and pass `name` on:

```python
def chat_model(*, endpoint: str | None = None) -> BaseChatModel:
    """The production chat model: `ChatDatabricks` on the configured endpoint,
    or `ChatCopilot` for a Copilot model (D77).

    Imported here rather than at module load so the seam's tests, which inject
    their own model, never touch the Databricks SDK. Authentication is the
    SDK's unified chain -- the app's service-principal variables on Databricks
    Apps, a CLI profile locally -- and no credential is read by this code.
    """
    name = endpoint or configured_endpoint()
    if copilot.parsed(name) is not None:
        return copilot.ChatCopilot(model=name)
    from databricks_langchain import ChatDatabricks

    from caos.workspace import workspace_client

    # A read deadline no longer than the whole call's (brief D5, F40, ST-9),
    # and no retry below the seam: a retry is the caller's reservation. The client
    # is the process's bounded one (CR-6): the default the library would
    # build carries the SDK's five-minute discovery budget.
    return ChatDatabricks(
        endpoint=name,
        max_tokens=MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS,
        timeout=TIMEOUT_SECONDS,
        max_retries=0,
        workspace_client=workspace_client(),
    )
```

Make three docstring edits:
- In `caos/models.py`, change the first line to `"""The one model factory: every production call goes through AI Gateway or Copilot.`
- In the same docstring, change the first paragraph's description of `chat_model` to "`ChatDatabricks` against the configured serving endpoint, or `ChatCopilot` for a Copilot model (D77, `caos/copilot.py`)".
- In `caos/provider.py`'s docstring, change "(Databricks AI Gateway through the one model factory)" to "(Databricks AI Gateway, or GitHub Copilot for a Copilot model, through the one model factory)".

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests to verify they pass**

Run: `uv run pytest --no-cov -p no:xdist tests/test_copilot.py tests/test_models.py tests/test_model_choice.py -q`
Expected: all pass, `test_the_production_model_is_chat_databricks_on_the_endpoint` unchanged.

Run: `uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run mypy caos scripts tests && uv run complexipy caos scripts icm --max-complexity-allowed 15 && uv run python scripts/check_tested.py && uv run python scripts/check_vocabulary.py`
Expected: all exit 0.

- [ ] **Step 6: The PR gates (end of Copilot 1/3)**

Run the full gate list in `CLAUDE.md`, with Postgres up (`docker compose up -d --wait`). Expected: all exit 0. That includes the suite under `CAOS_REQUIRE_POSTGRES=1` with coverage ≥ 80%, `uv run python scripts/check_gate_config.py`, and `uv run python scripts/check_pr_size.py origin/rebuild/databricks` (≤ 800).

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit, then open Copilot 1/3 when the owner asks**

```bash
git add caos/copilot.py caos/models.py caos/provider.py tests/test_copilot.py
git commit -m "Copilot 1/3: a copilot: model is answered through the Copilot SDK (D77)"
```

### Task 4: The Copilot CLI fallback

**Files:**
- Modify: `caos/copilot.py` (the `copilot-cli` platform, `overhead_bytes`, `cli_arguments`, `printed_events`, `ask_copilot_cli`, `_cli_asked`; dispatch in `ChatCopilot._generate`)
- Modify: `caos/models.py` (`ChatCompletions.request_bytes`)
- Modify: `docs/rebuild/decisions.md` (D78)
- Test: `tests/test_copilot.py` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `_data`, `reply_message`, `Event`, `CopilotModel` and `parsed` (Task 2); the factory dispatch (Task 3).
- Produces:
  - `CLI_PLATFORM = "copilot-cli"`, `CLI = "copilot"`, `CLI_OVERHEAD_BYTES = 65_536`;
  - `def overhead_bytes(model: str) -> int`;
  - `def cli_arguments(target: CopilotModel) -> list[str]`;
  - `def printed_events(printed: bytes) -> list[Event]`;
  - `def ask_copilot_cli(prompt: str, target: CopilotModel, seconds: float) -> list[Event]`.

Before Step 3, put Task 1's spellings from `help.txt` into `_CLI_FLAGS` wherever they differ from the defaults below.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Merge these imports into `tests/test_copilot.py`:

```python

    CLI_OVERHEAD_BYTES,
    ask_copilot_cli,
    cli_arguments,

```

Then append:

```python

CLI_TARGET = CopilotModel("copilot-cli", "claude-opus-5.5", "high")
CLI_PRICE = ModelPrice(

}
print("Copilot CLI banner, not an event")

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to verify they fail**

Run: `uv run pytest --no-cov -p no:xdist tests/test_copilot.py -q`
Expected: an `ImportError` for `CLI_OVERHEAD_BYTES`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the CLI transport**

In `caos/copilot.py`:
- in the module docstrings of `caos/copilot.py` and `tests/test_copilot.py`, and in `caos/models.py`'s docstring, change `(D77` to `(D77, D78`;
- add `import json`, `import os`, `import shutil` to the imports;
- set `_PLATFORMS = frozenset({PLATFORM, CLI_PLATFORM})`, defining `CLI_PLATFORM` above it;
- widen `_NAME`'s first group to `(copilot|copilot-cli)`;
- in `ChatCopilot._generate`, replace `asked: Ask = self.ask or ask_copilot` with:

```python
        transport = ask_copilot_cli if target.platform == CLI_PLATFORM else ask_copilot
        asked: Ask = self.ask or transport
```

Then append:

```python
CLI_PLATFORM = "copilot-cli"
# The executable the fallback runs, found on PATH as IT installed it (D78).
CLI = "copilot"
# Prompt mode as a model: JSON event lines, no tool, no custom instruction,

```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests to verify they pass**

Run: `uv run pytest --no-cov -p no:xdist tests/test_copilot.py tests/test_models.py -q`
Expected: all pass.

Run: `uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run mypy caos scripts tests && uv run complexipy caos scripts icm --max-complexity-allowed 15 && uv run python scripts/check_tested.py && uv run bandit -r caos scripts icm -f json -o bandit.json; uv run python scripts/scan_floors.py bandit.json --no-parse-errors --cover caos scripts icm --unscanned tests`
Expected: all exit 0, and bandit reports no finding.

- [ ] **Step 5: Adversarial review of the process start**

Run the `adversarial-reviewer` skill inline (or dispatch `mx-adversary` if the owner allows agents) on `_cli_asked`, `cli_arguments`, `printed_events` and `ask_copilot_cli`. The review covers:
- argument injection: the model id, the effort, a Windows `.cmd` shim;
- the prompt never reaching the command line;
- inherited environment and credentials;
- that `COPILOT_HOME` isolates extensions, skills, plugins and MCP;
- stdout parsing that could under-bill;
- a process left behind after a timeout (Windows included);
- stderr never read.

Fix what it confirms, recording each fix as an `Fn` in `decisions.md`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Record D78**

Append to `docs/rebuild/decisions.md`, using the next free D:

```markdown
- D78 (<YYYY-MM-DD>) — The Copilot CLI as a fallback transport, for a PC where the Copilot SDK or the runtime it provisions is not approved or not working (D77). A model named `copilot-cli:<model>[@<effort>]` is answered by the IT-installed `copilot` executable in prompt mode: the prompt on stdin (a module's prompt is far past a command line's limit, 32,767 characters on Windows); `--output-format json`, whose JSON lines are the runtime's session events in the same wire form the SDK delivers, read by the same `reply_message`; no tool (`--available-tools=`), `--no-custom-instructions`, `--no-auto-update`, `--stream off`, the long-context tier, `--model` and `--reasoning-effort`; a private `COPILOT_HOME` that is also the working folder and is removed after the call, so no extension, skill, plugin, MCP configuration, memory or trusted folder of the analyst's own reaches it; the `GITHUB_COPILOT_PROMPT_MODE_*` opt-ins never passed on; error output never read. It is chosen by name, never an automatic fallback: no flag replaces the CLI's own system prompt, so its answers are a different execution profile (`copilot-cli/<model>/<effort|none>/65536`) that qualifies separately, and a run pinned to one transport never switches (F468). Its request is priced and bounded with `CLI_OVERHEAD_BYTES` (64 KiB) added for that system prompt (Task 1 measured <n> tokens). The CLI caps output at the model's own limit, not `MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS`: an answer past 65,536 tokens is billed unknown and refused, as on the gateway. The process starts through `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`; bandit's subprocess checks do not cover asyncio's process API (checked: no finding), so the call carries neither a finding nor a suppression, and in the scanner's place it is shell-free, takes fixed flags and a matched model id only, and had an adversarial review (<reviewer>, <date>). A PC that may not install the SDK package syncs with `uv sync --locked --no-install-package github-copilot-sdk`: `caos/copilot.py` imports the SDK only inside the SDK transport and readiness. Alternatives: an automatic fallback from the SDK (two execution profiles in one run, against D8 and F468); the SDK over the IT-installed executable through `COPILOT_CLI_PATH` (still needs the SDK package and a protocol-compatible executable; recorded in the runbook as a configuration); `subprocess` with `nosec` (raises the suppression baseline, which may only fall). Evidence: `tests/test_copilot.py` (the `copilot-cli` tests).
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit; Copilot 2/3**

```bash
git add caos/copilot.py caos/models.py tests/test_copilot.py docs/rebuild/decisions.md
git commit -m "Copilot 2/3: the Copilot CLI as a fallback transport (D78)"
```

Run the PR gates as in Task 3 Step 6, against Copilot 1/3's branch. Open **Copilot 2/3**, stacked on 1/3, only when the owner asks.

---

### Task 5: Readiness at worker start and the production smoke

**Files:**
- Modify: `caos/copilot.py` (add `require_ready`, `usable`, `_offered`)
- Modify: `caos/graph/worker.py:597-611` (`_configured`)
- Modify: `scripts/gateway_smoke.py:30-41` (production check)
- Modify: `scripts/qualify.py:23-30` (docstring examples)
- Test: `tests/test_copilot.py` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `_client()`, `parsed`, `CopilotModel`, `CLI_PLATFORM`, `CLI` (Tasks 2–4); `copilot.ModelInfo` (for typing only).
- Produces:
  - `def require_ready(models: Iterable[str]) -> None`, which prints `copilot <model> max_prompt_tokens=<n>` to stderr for each SDK model and raises `Refusal(PROVIDER_NOT_CONFIGURED)` when not ready;
  - `def usable(info: ModelInfo, target: CopilotModel) -> bool`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Merge these imports into `tests/test_copilot.py`:

```python

In `caos/graph/worker.py`, add `from caos.copilot import require_ready`. In `_configured()`, directly after `choices = model_choices()`, add:

```python
    # The Copilot models among them answer on this machine (D77, D78): ready
    # here, or refused before the store is touched or a run claimed.
    require_ready(choices)
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Accept Copilot in the production smoke**

In `scripts/gateway_smoke.py`:
- change the first docstring line to `"""One real call through the production model path (A31): AI Gateway or Copilot.`;
- add the docstring sentence "For a Copilot model the chat model is `ChatCopilot` on its real transport (D77, D78), never a scripted one.";
- replace the class check in `main()` with:

```python
    from caos.copilot import ChatCopilot
    from caos.models import from_environment

    provider = from_environment()
    chat = provider.chat
    kind = type(chat).__name__
    # The production model only: `ChatDatabricks` on an endpoint, or
    # `ChatCopilot` on a real transport for a Copilot model, never a scripted one.
    production = kind == "ChatDatabricks" or (
        isinstance(chat, ChatCopilot) and chat.ask is None
    )
    if not production:
        print(f"gateway_smoke: refused, chat model is {kind}", file=sys.stderr)
        return 2
```

In `scripts/qualify.py`'s docstring, after the existing example, add:

```text
    # The same set through GitHub Copilot on this machine (D77), or through
    # the CLI fallback (D78) with `copilot-cli:` in place of `copilot:`:
    CAOS_MODEL_ENDPOINT=copilot:gpt-6-luna \
    CAOS_MODEL_PRICE=copilot:gpt-6-luna,<in>,<out>,<YYYY-MM-DD> \
    scripts/qualify.py qualification/ccl-fy2025-market-dislocation \
        --expect-identity copilot/gpt-6-luna/none/65536 --ceiling 5.00
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the tests to verify they pass**

Run: `uv run pytest --no-cov -p no:xdist tests/test_copilot.py tests/test_workspace_stub.py -q`
Expected: all pass, with `test_the_gateway_smoke_passes_over_http_with_chat_databricks` unchanged.

Run: `CAOS_TEST_POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://postgres:local-test-admin-only@127.0.0.1:55437/postgres CAOS_REQUIRE_POSTGRES=1 uv run pytest --no-cov -n auto tests/test_worker.py tests/test_worker_in_process.py tests/test_health.py -q`
Expected: all pass, since non-Copilot choices start no runtime.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add caos/copilot.py caos/graph/worker.py scripts/gateway_smoke.py scripts/qualify.py tests/test_copilot.py
git commit -m "Copilot 3/3: the worker refuses a Copilot model this machine cannot answer on"
```

### Task 6: The worker on a Windows PC

**Files:**
- Modify: `caos/graph/worker.py:547-549` (`install_stop_handler`; add `STOP_SIGNALS`)
- Modify: `caos/evidence/pdf.py:786` (`_limit_address_space`)
- Modify: `.gitattributes`
- Create: `tests/test_pc_worker.py`
- Modify: `docs/rebuild/decisions.md` (D79)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing new.
- Produces: `caos.graph.worker.STOP_SIGNALS: tuple[signal.Signals, ...]`, used by `install_stop_handler(stopping: Event) -> None` (signature unchanged).

Three facts this task fixes, found on 2026-10-01:
- `install_stop_handler` handles only SIGTERM, which a Windows console never sends. Ctrl+C therefore raises `KeyboardInterrupt` mid-module instead of draining.
- `_limit_address_space` imports the POSIX-only `resource` module unguarded, so PDF extraction in the child process fails with `ImportError` on Windows.
- `vendor/deploy-v/**` and `icm/**` are `text: unspecified` (per `git check-attr`). Git for Windows converts their line endings by default, so `Bundle.verify_manifest()` and the host-integrity digests refuse on an analyst's clone.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Create `tests/test_pc_worker.py`:

```python
"""The worker on an analyst's PC (D79): console stop signals, a platform with
no `resource` module, and the byte-verified trees checked out unconverted."""

from __future__ import annotations

import signal
import subprocess
import sys
from threading import Event

import pytest

from caos.evidence import pdf
from caos.graph.worker import STOP_SIGNALS, install_stop_handler


def test_ctrl_c_only_asks_the_worker_to_stop() -> None:
    stopping = Event()
    previous = {stop: signal.getsignal(stop) for stop in STOP_SIGNALS}
    install_stop_handler(stopping)
    try:
        signal.raise_signal(signal.SIGINT)
        assert stopping.is_set()
    finally:
        for stop, handler in previous.items():
            signal.signal(stop, handler)


def test_every_stop_signal_the_platform_has_is_handled() -> None:
    assert signal.SIGTERM in STOP_SIGNALS
    assert signal.SIGINT in STOP_SIGNALS
    if sys.platform == "win32":
        assert signal.SIGBREAK in STOP_SIGNALS


def test_a_platform_with_no_resource_module_still_extracts(
    monkeypatch: pytest.MonkeyPatch,
) -> None:
    monkeypatch.setitem(sys.modules, "resource", None)
    pdf._limit_address_space(pdf._Inflater(1024))


@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "path", ["vendor/deploy-v/CANON_SHARED.md", "icm/HOST_INTEGRITY_v1.json"]
)
def test_the_byte_verified_trees_are_never_converted(path: str) -> None:
    attributes = subprocess.run(
        ["git", "check-attr", "text", "--", path],
        capture_output=True,
        text=True,
        check=True,
    ).stdout
    assert attributes.strip() == f"{path}: text: unset"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to verify they fail**

Run: `uv run pytest --no-cov -p no:xdist tests/test_pc_worker.py -q`
Expected: `ImportError: cannot import name 'STOP_SIGNALS'`. Once that is stubbed, the `resource` test fails with `ImportError` and the byte-pin test fails with `text: unspecified`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

In `caos/graph/worker.py`, replace `install_stop_handler`:

```python
# What stops a worker: SIGTERM from a platform, and Ctrl+C (SIGINT) or, on
# Windows, Ctrl+Break (SIGBREAK) from the console an analyst runs it in (D79).
STOP_SIGNALS: tuple[signal.Signals, ...] = tuple(
    getattr(signal, name)
    for name in ("SIGTERM", "SIGINT", "SIGBREAK")
    if hasattr(signal, name)
)


def install_stop_handler(stopping: Event) -> None:
    """A stop signal only sets `stopping`; the loop decides when that is safe."""
    for stop in STOP_SIGNALS:
        signal.signal(stop, lambda _signum, _frame: stopping.set())
```

In `caos/evidence/pdf.py`, inside `_limit_address_space`, replace `    import resource` with:

```python
    try:
        import resource
    except ImportError:
        # Windows has no `resource` (D79): the child is still bounded by its
        # deadline and the decoded-bytes budget, as it is on macOS.
        return
```

Append to `.gitattributes`:

```text
# Byte-verified where they are used (invariant 4; icm/HOST_INTEGRITY_v1.json):
# a checkout that converts line endings -- Git for Windows does by default --
# must still hold these bytes, or the worker refuses to start (D79).
vendor/deploy-v/** -text
icm/** -text
```

Then check that nothing in the index changes: `git add --renormalize . && git status --short`. Expected: only the files this task edited.

Do not add a Windows CI job. `scripts/check_gate_config.py` pins every job to `RUNS_ON = "ubuntu-latest"`, and widening that is a gate change only the owner can make (N125). The tests above run on Linux. Task 7's start of the worker on the analyst's PC is the Windows proof, because `_configured()` verifies the bundle manifest and the host prompts on that clone.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests and the gate checks**

Run: `uv run pytest --no-cov -p no:xdist tests/test_pc_worker.py -q`
Expected: all pass.

Run: `CAOS_TEST_POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://postgres:local-test-admin-only@127.0.0.1:55437/postgres CAOS_REQUIRE_POSTGRES=1 uv run pytest --no-cov -n auto tests/test_worker.py tests/test_pdf_extraction.py -q && uv run python scripts/check_gate_config.py && uv run pre-commit run --all-files`
Expected: all exit 0.

- [ ] **Step 5: Record D79**

Append to `docs/rebuild/decisions.md`, using the next free D:

```markdown
- D79 (<YYYY-MM-DD>) — The worker on an analyst's Windows PC, where the Copilot seat is (D77, D78). Three facts stopped it: `install_stop_handler` handled SIGTERM only, which a console never sends, so Ctrl+C raised `KeyboardInterrupt` mid-module (it now handles SIGTERM, SIGINT and, on Windows, SIGBREAK, and only sets `stopping`); `caos/evidence/pdf.py` imported the POSIX-only `resource` module unguarded in the extraction child (it now returns, as on macOS, and the child stays bounded by its deadline and decoded-bytes budget); and `vendor/deploy-v/**` and `icm/**` were `text: unspecified`, so Git for Windows' default `core.autocrlf=true` changed the bytes the bundle manifest and `HOST_INTEGRITY_v1.json` verify (both are now `-text`). There is no Windows CI job: `scripts/check_gate_config.py` pins every job to `ubuntu-latest`, and widening it is the owner's call (N125). The worker's first start on the analyst's PC, which verifies the bundle and the host prompts on a Windows clone, is the Windows proof. Alternatives: WSL (one more install for IT to approve, and blocked on many managed PCs); a clone-time instruction alone (forgotten once, the worker refuses with an opaque bytes mismatch). Evidence: `tests/test_pc_worker.py`, and the PC run in the plan's Task 7.
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add caos/graph/worker.py caos/evidence/pdf.py .gitattributes tests/test_pc_worker.py docs/rebuild/decisions.md
git commit -m "Copilot 3/3: the worker runs on an analyst's Windows PC (D79)"
```

### Task 7: The runbook, the records and the live run

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/COPILOT_WORKER.md`
- Modify: `docs/rebuild/next.md` (N121–N125), `docs/rebuild/ENTERPRISE_HANDOFF.md` (§1), `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` (section 1), `CLAUDE.md` (Layer 0 sentence, repo map)
- Modify (only if Step 4 hits a missing external resource): `docs/rebuild/blockers.md` (B13)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 1's `SUMMARY.md` (auth methods, model ids, prompt limits, prices, CLI flags, over-limit behaviour).
- Produces: the runbook the analyst follows. No code.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write `docs/COPILOT_WORKER.md`**

Wherever the content below says **[Task 1 result]**, use the corresponding fact from Task 1's `SUMMARY.md`. Content:

````markdown
# The worker on an analyst's PC (GitHub Copilot)

AI Gateway is disabled in the enterprise workspace, so module calls go to GitHub Copilot (D77) from the one place a Copilot seat lives: the analyst's PC. Only the worker runs there. Lakebase keeps the queue, the attempt ledger and the checkpoints; the Unity Catalog volume keeps every byte; the API and UI run wherever the hosting decision puts them. A run advances only while a worker runs.

| Part | Where |
|---|---|
| Worker (`python -m caos.graph.worker`) and the Copilot runtime | The analyst's PC |
| Store, ledger, checkpoints | Lakebase (unchanged) |
| Sources and artifacts by digest | UC volume `caos_blobs` (unchanged) |
| API and UI | Unchanged by this page; they must approve the same models as the worker |

## 1. Decisions and grants first (owner and administrators)

- **Data:** Compliance confirms that issuer documents may be sent to the Copilot models chosen. Every prompt carries document text.
- **Seat and policy:** the analyst holds a Copilot Business or Enterprise seat, and the organisation's policy enables Copilot CLI (both transports run its runtime) and each chosen model.
- **Spend:** a Business seat includes 1,900 AI credits ($19) a month and an Enterprise seat 3,900 ($39), and one LITE run on Claude Opus can use more. The owner sets a GitHub budget for overage. Each run's CAOS ceiling still applies.
- **Network from the PC:** HTTPS to the workspace, TLS Postgres to the Lakebase endpoint's host on port 5432, and HTTPS to GitHub's Copilot endpoints.
- **Lakebase:** the analyst's Databricks identity needs a Postgres role on the project. If the app's service principal created `caos_store` and `caos_graph`, it (or a Lakebase administrator) grants:
  ```sql
  GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA caos_store, caos_graph TO "<analyst's Databricks user name>";
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA caos_store, caos_graph TO "<analyst's Databricks user name>";
  GRANT USAGE, SELECT, UPDATE ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA caos_store, caos_graph TO "<analyst's Databricks user name>";
  ```
  With no app deployed, the analyst's role creates both schemas on the worker's first start, and no grant is needed.
- **Volume:** `READ VOLUME` and `WRITE VOLUME` on `<catalog>.<schema>.caos_blobs` for the analyst.

## 2. Install (once)

1. Install Git, `uv`, the Databricks CLI and the GitHub Copilot CLI from IT's approved sources.
2. Run `git clone <the enterprise repository>`, then `uv sync --locked --no-dev` in the clone; `uv` brings Python 3.13. If the SDK package may not be installed here, use `uv sync --locked --no-dev --no-install-package github-copilot-sdk` instead and follow section 6.
3. Run `databricks auth login --profile caos --host <workspace URL>`.
4. Provision the SDK's runtime once: `uv run python -m copilot download-runtime`. Then set `COPILOT_SKIP_CLI_DOWNLOAD=1` permanently, so nothing is downloaded at run time.
5. Sign in to Copilot. **[Task 1 result: keep exactly the one of these two lines that worked]**
   - Run `copilot login`; both transports use that sign-in.
   - Set `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` in the worker's environment to a fine-grained token with the "Copilot Requests" permission.

## 3. Price each model

GitHub publishes each model's dollar rates per million tokens (docs.github.com, "Models and pricing for GitHub Copilot"). `list_models` reports the same rates in AI credits, at 1 credit = $0.01.

- **Per token:** input is `max(input, cache write) / 1,000,000` and output is `output / 1,000,000`. Where a model's rates rise above a context length, use the higher tier, because the worker asks for the long-context tier.
- **Example:** Claude Opus 5.5 on 2026-10-01 cost $4.00 input, $5.00 cache write and $20.00 output per million, which gives `copilot:<opus id>@high,0.000005,0.00002,2026-10-01`.
- **Ceiling:** one worst-case call at that price is 4 MiB × 0.000005 + 65,536 × 0.00002 = 22.28224, and the run ceiling must cover it.

Choose models by prompt limit. The worker prints each SDK model's `max_prompt_tokens` at start. **[Task 1 result: the candidates' limits under `long_context`.]** A module whose prompt exceeds the limit is **[Task 1 result: refused 400/413 before billing | billed and refused]**, and the run parks. CP-0 sends whole filings, so a large 10-K needs the 1M tier.

## 4. Run the worker

PowerShell, in the clone:

```powershell
$env:DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE = "caos"
$env:CAOS_LAKEBASE_ENDPOINT = "projects/<project>/branches/production/endpoints/primary"
$env:PGHOST = "<the endpoint's host>"
$env:PGPORT = "5432"
$env:PGDATABASE = "databricks_postgres"
$env:PGUSER = "<your Databricks user name>"
$env:CAOS_BLOB_ROOT = "volume:///Volumes/<catalog>/<schema>/caos_blobs"
$env:CAOS_MODEL_ENDPOINT = "copilot:<model>[@<effort>]"
$env:CAOS_MODEL_PRICE = "copilot:<model>[@<effort>],<in>,<out>,<YYYY-MM-DD>"
$env:CAOS_RUN_CEILING = "100.00"
$env:COPILOT_SKIP_CLI_DOWNLOAD = "1"
uv run --no-sync python scripts/gateway_smoke.py
uv run --no-sync python -m caos.graph.worker
```

- **Smoke:** one paid call of a few tokens. It must print `model=ChatCopilot ... json_mode=accepted`.
- **Start:** the worker prints `copilot <model> max_prompt_tokens=<n>` for each SDK model. It exits 2 with `PROVIDER_NOT_CONFIGURED` when Copilot is not ready (not signed in, model not enabled, effort not taken, CLI missing for a `copilot-cli:` model, SDK missing for a `copilot:` model), or with `STORE_UNAVAILABLE` when Lakebase is unreachable or the role is missing.
- **Stop:** Ctrl+C stops it after the module in flight. Closing the window kills it; the run's lease then expires after 600 s and the next worker resumes it, with no attempt run twice.

## 5. What this does not do

- No run advances while no worker runs, and one worker spends one Copilot seat.
- There is no in-app chat (Query) until RAI is onboarded.
- Hosting the API and UI with Copilot models is a separate step (N124).

## 6. Fallback: the Copilot CLI (D78)

Use this when the SDK package or its runtime may not be installed or will not start. Name each model `copilot-cli:<model>[@<effort>]` in `CAOS_MODEL_ENDPOINT`, `CAOS_MODEL_PRICE` and the API's approved models, priced exactly as in section 3. The worker then runs the `copilot` executable on `PATH` once per module call:
- the prompt goes on stdin;
- the events come back as JSON lines;
- no tools are offered, and no custom instructions or self-update are used;
- each call runs under a private `COPILOT_HOME` that is removed afterwards.

How it differs from the SDK:
- **System prompt:** Copilot's own system prompt wraps every call, because no flag replaces it. A `copilot-cli:` model is therefore a different execution profile (`copilot-cli/<model>/<effort|none>/65536`) and must be qualified on its own (`scripts/qualify.py --expect-identity copilot-cli/...`).
- **Pricing allowance:** each request is priced with 64 KiB added for that system prompt.
- **Output cap:** output is capped at the model's own limit, not 65,536 tokens. An answer past 65,536 is billed as unknown and refused.
- **Not automatic:** CAOS never switches a run between transports. A run started on `copilot:` stays on `copilot:`.

If the SDK package is installed but its runtime is not approved, a third option is to point the SDK at the IT-installed executable with `COPILOT_CLI_PATH=<path to copilot>` instead of step 2.4. This works only if that executable speaks the SDK's protocol version: run the smoke to check.
````

- [ ] **Step 2: Records**

Append to `docs/rebuild/next.md`, re-reading it first for the next free N (ids as of `25b4ca2`):

```markdown
- N121 (<date>; D77) — An in-memory session filesystem (`session_fs`) if no prompt may touch the PC's disk even for the length of its call (today a private temp directory, removed after the call; a crash can leave it).
- N122 (<date>; D77) — One long-lived Copilot client per worker if the runtime's start-up (Task 1: seconds per call) shows in node latency.
- N123 (<date>; D77) — Reconcile each call's charge against GitHub's own figure (`copilotUsage.totalNanoAiu` on `assistant.usage`), stored per attempt.
- N124 (<date>; D77) — Hosting with Copilot models: the bundle's `model_endpoint` serving-endpoint resource and `CAN_QUERY` grant, `scripts/preflight.py`'s endpoint checks and `scripts/enterprise_deploy.sh` rows E1/E10 assume a gateway endpoint; an App whose approved models are Copilot's needs them made conditional. Pending the hosting answer.
- N125 (<date>; D79) — A Windows CI runner for the PC worker's tests: `scripts/check_gate_config.py` pins every job to `ubuntu-latest` (`RUNS_ON`), so a `windows-latest` job is a gate change for the owner to approve. Until then, the worker's start on the analyst's PC is the Windows proof (D79).
```

Then update the pointers:
The 2026-10-01 initialisation already wrote status notes and the "No other provider" bullet that say Copilot is *being built*. Now say it is built:
- In `docs/rebuild/ENTERPRISE_HANDOFF.md`, replace the 2026-10-01 status note with: "AI Gateway is disabled in the enterprise workspace (B12). Model calls go to GitHub Copilot from a worker on the analyst's PC: follow `docs/COPILOT_WORKER.md` in place of the steps here that need a serving endpoint (D77–D79)." In "No other provider", replace "once D77 is built, " with nothing. Append "A Copilot model's effort is part of its name (D77)." to "No reasoning-effort setting".
- In `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, replace the status note's last two sentences with a pointer to `docs/COPILOT_WORKER.md` (D77–D79), and add a row to section 1 after the endpoint rows: "Workspace without AI Gateway | — | Module calls go to GitHub Copilot from a worker on the analyst's PC: `docs/COPILOT_WORKER.md` (D77–D79)."
- In `CLAUDE.md`, change Layer 0's "so the factory is gaining GitHub Copilot as the model, answered on the worker's machine (D77); that build is `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-01-copilot-sdk-adapter.md`" to "so GitHub Copilot is the model there, answered on the worker's machine (D77–D79, `docs/COPILOT_WORKER.md`)". In the repo map, after `models.py` (the model factory), add `copilot.py` (the Copilot transports).

- [ ] **Step 3: Gates and Copilot 3/3**

Run the full gate list in `CLAUDE.md`, then `uv run python scripts/check_pr_size.py <Copilot 2/3's branch>`. Expected: all exit 0.

```bash
git add docs/COPILOT_WORKER.md docs/rebuild/next.md docs/rebuild/ENTERPRISE_HANDOFF.md docs/DEPLOYMENT.md CLAUDE.md
git commit -m "Copilot 3/3: the analyst-PC runbook and the records (D77-D79)"
```

Open **Copilot 3/3**, stacked on 2/3, only when the owner asks.

- [ ] **Step 4: Live verification (owner-authorised spend, on the PC)**

Ask the owner for an amount first: pennies for the smokes, plus a ceiling for one qualification run on the cheapest model whose limit fits. **$5.00** is proposed.

1. Follow `docs/COPILOT_WORKER.md` §2–§4 on the PC. Expected:
   - the smoke prints `model=ChatCopilot`, a known charge and `json_mode=accepted`;
   - the worker prints `copilot <model> max_prompt_tokens=<n>` and runs. Its start verifies the bundle and the host prompts on this Windows clone, which is D79's Windows proof;
   - `/api/health` reports workers OK wherever the API runs.
2. Repeat the smoke with `CAOS_MODEL_ENDPOINT` and `CAOS_MODEL_PRICE` naming `copilot-cli:<the same model>`. Expected: the same three facts.
3. On a machine with Docker Postgres and the same Copilot sign-in, run:

   ```bash
   CAOS_QUALIFY_POSTGRES_URL=<persistent server> \
   CAOS_QUALIFY_BLOB_ROOT=<kept directory> \
   CAOS_MODEL_ENDPOINT=copilot:<luna id> \
   CAOS_MODEL_PRICE=copilot:<luna id>,<in>,<out>,<date> \
   uv run python scripts/qualify.py qualification/ccl-fy2025-market-dislocation \
     --expect-identity copilot/<luna id>/none/65536 --ceiling 5.00
   ```

   Record the outcome in `qualification/PROVIDER_RUNBOOK.md`: per node, the code, the charge, and the largest prompt's tokens against the model's limit.
4. If an external resource is missing (port 5432 blocked, Lakebase role absent, Copilot CLI policy off), add **B13** to `docs/rebuild/blockers.md` with the exact command and error. Correct the runbook to the commands that actually ran, then commit:

```bash
git add docs/COPILOT_WORKER.md qualification/PROVIDER_RUNBOOK.md docs/rebuild/blockers.md
git commit -m "Copilot 3/3: the runbook as it ran on the analyst's PC"
```

---

## Out of scope (named so nothing is silently dropped)

- **Hosting** the API and UI as a Databricks App with Copilot models (N124), pending the hosting answer. Until then the API runs wherever it does today, approving the same models as the worker.
- **The in-app Query chat**: it needs a server-side model, which means RAI after onboarding (a later provider behind the same factory).
- **Copilot as orchestrator** (skills per module, Delta over ODBC): rejected in D77.
- **An automatic SDK-to-CLI fallback**: rejected in D78 (two execution profiles in one run).
- **Two analysts' workers at once**: this already works through leases, but each worker spends its own seat. No change is needed.
