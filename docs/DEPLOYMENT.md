# Deploying CAOS to an enterprise Databricks workspace

This repository deploys as one Databricks App from an asset bundle. Nothing in the tree names a workspace: every value that differs per deployment is a bundle variable, and authentication comes from the Databricks CLI profile of whoever deploys. The steps below are what a workspace administrator runs once, then what a deployer runs per release. The gateway path is marked unverified in `docs/rebuild/blockers.md` until step 5 has been run in a real workspace.

> **Status, 2026-10-01.** AI Gateway is disabled in the enterprise workspace (`docs/rebuild/blockers.md` B12), so the serving-endpoint prerequisite below and the smoke in section 5 cannot be met there. The bundle still names a serving endpoint, so it cannot deploy there as it stands (the plan's N124). Model calls are moving to GitHub Copilot from a worker on the analyst's PC (D77), built from `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-01-copilot-sdk-adapter.md`; its runbook will be `docs/COPILOT_WORKER.md`. Lakebase and the volume are unchanged.

## 1. Prerequisites in the workspace

| Resource | Bundle variable | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| A serving endpoint under AI Gateway: the model a run gets when it names none | `model_endpoint` (bundle default `databricks-claude-opus-5`; the one command has no default, F469) | The workspace's own name for it: `databricks serving-endpoints list -p <profile>` lists them, and a custom or external endpoint rarely carries the `databricks-` prefix. Pay-per-token Foundation Model API endpoints work as they are; an external-model endpoint must be created under Serving with AI Gateway enabled, and then every prompt, which carries document text, leaves the workspace for that provider. Preflight refuses an endpoint that logs payloads (an inference table, the legacy auto-capture, or telemetry that samples requests), exports logs or traces, falls back to another model, or serves more than one entity, and the same for an update still pending on it (section 7): where the workspace's own policy requires payload logging, that is a conflict for the owner, not a setting to change. The app's service principal needs `CAN_QUERY`; the bundle grants it. |
| A dated price for exactly that endpoint | `model_price` | `endpoint,input_per_token,output_per_token,YYYY-MM-DD`: dollars per token, input and output, dated no later than today. Budgets fail closed on it. A pay-per-token Foundation Model API endpoint is billed in DBUs: the per-token price is its DBUs per token times the contract's price per DBU. An external-model endpoint is billed at the provider's contract rates. A provisioned-throughput endpoint is billed by the hour, so no per-token price is exact: the owner names the figure the budgets reserve on. The bundle's default names the public list price on the day this repository was written; the one command requires the contract's (F469). |
| The other models a run may be started on (optional) | `model_choices` (default empty) | Each approved endpoint's dated price in `model_price`'s form, joined by `;` (D75). The Run section offers these beside `model_endpoint`, and a run is pinned to the one chosen. Each must pass preflight's endpoint rules and afford one call under `run_ceiling`. The bundle grants `CAN_QUERY` on `model_endpoint` alone (an app's resources are a fixed list, not one per variable entry), so a workspace administrator grants it on each of these to the app's service principal, after the first deploy has created it: `databricks serving-endpoints update-permissions <endpoint id> --json '{"access_control_list":[{"service_principal_name":"<application id>","permission_level":"CAN_QUERY"}]}'`, the id from `databricks serving-endpoints get <endpoint> -o json` and the application id from `databricks apps get caos -o json` (`service_principal_client_id`). `update-permissions` adds; `set-permissions` replaces the endpoint's whole list and would remove everyone else's access. |
| A Unity Catalog schema and a volume `caos_blobs` in it | `uc_catalog`, `uc_schema` | `CREATE VOLUME <catalog>.<schema>.caos_blobs`. Sources and artifacts live there by digest; the app's service principal needs `WRITE_VOLUME` (granted by the bundle). |
| A Lakebase Autoscaling project (the default kind) | `lakebase_project`, `lakebase_branch` (default `production`), `lakebase_endpoint` (default `primary`, the branch's read-write endpoint), `lakebase_database_id` (default `databricks-postgres`, the database's resource id: `databricks postgres list-databases projects/<project>/branches/<branch>` lists them) | Bound by the `dev` and `prod` targets as the app's `postgres` resource (`CAN_CONNECT_AND_CREATE` on the branch's database) with `CAOS_LAKEBASE_ENDPOINT` naming the endpoint the app mints its credential for through the Postgres API. New Provisioned instances cannot be created since 12 March 2026, so a new deployment uses this kind. |
| Or an existing Lakebase Provisioned instance | `lakebase_instance`, `lakebase_database` (default `databricks_postgres`) | Bound only by the `dev-provisioned` and `prod-provisioned` targets (the one command's `--provisioned` flag), as the app's `database` resource with `CAOS_LAKEBASE_INSTANCE`; the credential is minted through the database API. A variable cannot switch the resource's form, so the target does (N45). Everything below applies to both kinds. |
| The store's database, either kind | as above | The store's tables are applied on first start in the store's own schema, `caos_store`, which the app creates; LangGraph checkpoints go to schema `caos_graph` on the same database, created the same way (DL-1). The app's service principal needs `CAN_CONNECT_AND_CREATE` (granted by the bundle), which the Apps documentation describes as `CONNECT` and `CREATE` on the database: `CREATE` on the database is what creating both schemas takes, and the principal owns what it creates in them, so no grant is run by hand. Since N3 that `CREATE` is needed only for the first boot, which creates the schemas: a later boot creates neither schema when it is already there, so it needs only ownership of `caos_store` and `caos_graph` and of everything in them, and a DBA may withdraw `CREATE` on the database once the app has started once (`tests/test_store_schema.py::test_a_role_without_database_create_boots_on_the_schemas_it_owns`). Ownership is what every boot checks (W2): a schema another role owns, or holds anything in, refuses the start, and the `store` health probe reads `STORE_SCHEMA_DRIFT` for it between boots. Nothing goes in `public`, where PostgreSQL 15 and later give nobody `CREATE` (MAX-22). `tests/test_platform_boot.py` starts the app holding exactly these grants, with `public` revoked, and shows a role without `CREATE` on the database refused at its first start with `schema: sqlstate 42501` on stderr and nothing else. An earlier build put the store in `public`; no deployment ever held data there, so no data migration is provided. |
| Two workspace groups | `group_admin` (default `caos-admins`), `group_analyst` (default `caos-analysts`) | Members of the admin group act as ADMIN, of the analyst group as ANALYST; any other authenticated user is READER. |
| What one run may spend | `run_ceiling` (default `120.00`, D29, D83) | Must cover one worst-case call at `model_price` (about 22.61 at the default price); preflight refuses less (F28). |
| The forwarded-token preview | none | `forward_user_access_token` is a preview feature Databricks must enable for the workspace (F53); row E5 reads it back. Changing it on an existing app needs `databricks apps stop` then `start`. |
| Who may open the app | `group_admin` → `CAN_USE`, `group_analyst` → `CAN_USE` | Granted by the bundle (F50); a user outside both groups is stopped at the proxy. Neither business group manages the app (W3): `CAN_MANAGE` deploys code as the app's principal, which writes the ledger, so only the deployer holds it. Members must be in the groups directly: SCIM `Me` does not expand nested groups. |
| The app's Lakebase role | none | `CAN_CONNECT_AND_CREATE` is expected to provision the app's service principal as a Postgres role; row E6's `store` code says whether it did. |

Check them with the deployer's profile before the first deploy:

```bash
DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE=<profile> uv run python scripts/preflight.py \
  --endpoint <endpoint> --catalog <catalog> --schema <schema> \
  --lakebase-project <project> \
  --price <endpoint>,<in>,<out>,<YYYY-MM-DD> --run-ceiling 120.00 \
  --choices '<endpoint>,<in>,<out>,<YYYY-MM-DD>;<endpoint>,<in>,<out>,<YYYY-MM-DD>'
```

`--lakebase-branch`, `--lakebase-endpoint` and `--lakebase-database-id` take the bundle's defaults when not given. It looks up the project, the endpoint (refused if read-only or disabled) and the database through the Postgres API; for an existing Provisioned instance pass `--lakebase-instance <instance>` instead of `--lakebase-project`, and the instance is looked up through the database API.

## 2. Build the tree that ships

```bash
uv sync --locked --all-groups
npm --prefix frontend ci --ignore-scripts && npm --prefix frontend run build
```

`frontend/dist` is git-ignored but included by the bundle's `sync.include`, so the static export the app serves is the one built here.

## 3. One command

```bash
scripts/enterprise_deploy.sh <profile> <catalog> <schema> <lakebase-project> \
  <endpoint> <endpoint>,<in>,<out>,<YYYY-MM-DD> [<run-ceiling>] [<model-choices>]
scripts/enterprise_deploy.sh --provisioned <profile> <catalog> <schema> <lakebase-instance> \
  <endpoint> <endpoint>,<in>,<out>,<YYYY-MM-DD> [<run-ceiling>] [<model-choices>]    # an existing Provisioned instance
```

Without the flag the fourth argument is the Lakebase Autoscaling project and the target is `TARGET` (`prod`); with `--provisioned` it is the Provisioned instance and the target is `TARGET`'s pair, `prod-provisioned` (or `dev-provisioned`). `TARGET` itself names `dev` or `prod` only. It runs sections 1, 3 and 5 of this page in order and writes one evidence row per step to `docs/rebuild/runs/<today>/enterprise/<time>/evidence.tsv` (E1 preflight, for the kind the target binds and for every approved model; E2–E4 the three bundle commands, E2 being `validate -o json`, whose resolved app name, endpoint, price, model choices, run ceiling and both group names (in the app's environment and its CAN_USE grants, commas included) must be the ones given, DF-4, DF-5, W8, and whose Lakebase binding must be the target's kind with the values given, the `database` resource's branch and database (or instance and database name) included, R24-14, N2; E5 the state and URL of the app E2 resolved; E6 health; E7 the gateway smoke in JSON mode; E8 the Lakebase version for D17, reached through the bound kind's own API; E9 the event stream through the proxy for C42, which must keep delivering frames for 3 s, none more than 1.5 s apart, DF-2; E10 one model call through the app's own HTTP surface, not this script's process or credentials, CF-054: a tiny text source admitted to the case E9 left behind, a LITE run started, and its Run section read on each event until the first node's call answered, as an accepted attempt or a validated Blocked verdict; a refused call, a park or a pre-call refusal fails the row and names its code, W1), stopping at the first failure. `TARGET`, `LAKEBASE_BRANCH`, `LAKEBASE_ENDPOINT` and `LAKEBASE_DATABASE_ID` (Autoscaling), `LAKEBASE_DATABASE` (Provisioned), `GROUP_ADMIN`, `GROUP_ANALYST` and `EVIDENCE` are read from the environment when set, each defaulting to the bundle's own default; the endpoint, price, run ceiling and model choices are arguments 5 to 8 only, and an inherited `MODEL_ENDPOINT`, `MODEL_PRICE`, `RUN_CEILING` or `MODEL_CHOICES` is ignored (N5). Arguments 5 and 6 have no default: the workspace's endpoint and its contract price are always given (F469). The manual commands below are what it runs.

## 3a. Validate and deploy by hand

```bash
export DATABRICKS_BUNDLE_ENGINE=direct                    # the engine every stand-in run used
export BUNDLE_VAR_model_price=<endpoint,in,out,date>      # commas: the CLI splits a --var on them (C1)
export BUNDLE_VAR_model_choices='<endpoint,in,out,date>;<endpoint,in,out,date>'   # empty or unset: none
VARS=(--var model_endpoint=<endpoint> --var uc_catalog=<catalog> --var uc_schema=<schema>
  --var lakebase_project=<project>)                       # and run_ceiling, lakebase_branch, lakebase_endpoint,
                                                          # lakebase_database_id, the groups when not the defaults
# An existing Provisioned instance: -t prod-provisioned, and --var lakebase_instance=<instance>
# (and lakebase_database) in place of the lakebase_project line.
databricks bundle validate -t prod -p <profile> "${VARS[@]}"
databricks bundle validate -t prod -p <profile> -o json "${VARS[@]}" \
  | jq '.resources.apps.caos | {name, env: .config.env}'  # the name and values the app will get
databricks bundle deploy -t prod -p <profile> "${VARS[@]}"
databricks bundle run caos -t prod -p <profile> "${VARS[@]}"   # starts, or restarts on new code
databricks apps get caos -p <profile>                     # app_status.state RUNNING
```

Every one of these commands resolves the whole bundle again, so each takes the same `--var` values and the exported `BUNDLE_VAR_model_price`: a value given to `deploy` is not remembered for `run`, and `uc_catalog`, `uc_schema` and the target's own Lakebase name (`lakebase_project`, or `lakebase_instance` for a `-provisioned` target) have no default (MAX-N02); the other kind's name is left unbound by the target and needs no value.

The App installs from `uv.lock` on Python 3.13 (`requires-python`) with `uv run --locked --no-dev` (F49); there is deliberately no `requirements.txt`, which would switch the platform to pip and Python 3.11. `app.yaml` sets no environment: the bundle's `config` is the one source (F52).

## 4. What the app expects at runtime

Set by the platform: `DATABRICKS_HOST`, `DATABRICKS_WORKSPACE_ID` (boot refuses without it, F46), `DATABRICKS_APP_PORT`, `DATABRICKS_APP_NAME`, `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID`/`_SECRET`, `PGHOST`/`PGPORT`/`PGDATABASE`/`PGUSER`/`PGSSLMODE` (from the database resource, in either form; that the platform injects them for the `postgres` form as it does for the `database` form is what E6's `store` code confirms on the first Autoscaling deploy) and `x-forwarded-access-token` on each request (`forward_user_access_token: true`, scope `iam.current-user:read`).

Set by the bundle: `CAOS_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0`, `CAOS_WORKER_IN_PROCESS=1`, `CAOS_SITE_ROOT=frontend/dist`, `CAOS_MODEL_ENDPOINT`, `CAOS_MODEL_PRICE`, `CAOS_MODEL_CHOICES` (`model_price;model_choices`: the configured price first, so the value is never empty), `CAOS_RUN_CEILING`, `CAOS_BLOB_ROOT=volume:///Volumes/<catalog>/<schema>/caos_blobs`, `CAOS_GROUP_ADMIN`, `CAOS_GROUP_ANALYST`, and exactly one Lakebase: `CAOS_LAKEBASE_ENDPOINT=projects/<project>/branches/<branch>/endpoints/<endpoint>` in `dev` and `prod`, or `CAOS_LAKEBASE_INSTANCE=<instance>` in the `-provisioned` targets. Both, neither (with the `PG*` values present) or an endpoint that is not an endpoint's resource path is refused at boot: the process prints `STORE_NOT_CONFIGURED` and does not start, and nothing is minted (R24-14).

Identity: the platform proxy is the edge. The app reads the forwarded token, resolves the caller through SCIM `Me`, mints a stable subject from the workspace id and the SCIM id, and maps the two group names to roles. Every identity header a client could send is dropped before the API sees it.

## 5. Smoke test after the first deploy

```bash
TOKEN=$(DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE=<profile> uv run python -c \
  "from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient as W; print(W().config.authenticate()['Authorization'])")
curl -fsS -H "Authorization: $TOKEN" \
  "$(databricks apps get caos -p <profile> | jq -r .url)/api/health"
DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE=<profile> CAOS_MODEL_ENDPOINT=<endpoint> \
  CAOS_MODEL_PRICE=<endpoint,in,out,date> uv run python scripts/gateway_smoke.py
```

`/api/health` sits behind the Apps proxy like every other route: an unauthenticated request never reaches the app, so the curl above carries the same bearer `scripts/enterprise_deploy.py`'s `_headers()` reads from the SDK's unified auth (`WorkspaceClient().config.authenticate()`). `$TOKEN` holds the word `Bearer` and the token together; nothing here prints it, and it belongs in a variable, never in a logged command line.

Health must answer 200 with `python_version` starting `3.13` and `status: ready`; the smoke script must print the endpoint, `model=ChatDatabricks`, a response id and token usage. Record the Lakebase `SELECT version()` on first connection in `docs/rebuild/decisions.md` (D17).

## 6. Rolling back a release

The store runs only code whose migration list is its own: a release's first boot applies its migrations (`apply_schema`), and from then on code with a shorter or different list is refused at boot with `STORE_SCHEMA_DRIFT` and does not start. Migrations are forward-only, with no "down" migration. So a rollback is a redeploy only when the older commit carries exactly the release's migrations. Decide that first, from the release's own checkout, before checking anything else out (C1):

```bash
uv run python scripts/rollback_check.py <older commit> --release <the commit the release was deployed from>
```

**Exit 0: redeploy.** The older commit carries the release's migrations in order and byte for byte, and reads the same schema (`caos_store`). Check it out and run the same one command (section 3) against it, or section 3a by hand at that commit; `bundle deploy` overwrites the app's code and restarts it, and leaves the store as it is. Row E6's `store` code `OK` is the proof that the older code accepted the store.

**Exit 1: do not redeploy that commit.** It names one of two reasons:

- The release applied a migration the older commit does not carry. Its app would refuse the store at boot (`STORE_SCHEMA_DRIFT`, E6 `store` not `OK`) and production would stay down until a commit carrying the migration is deployed again.
- The older commit is from before DL-1 (F219), which moved the store from `public` into `caos_store`. Its code reads `public`, finds no store there, creates an empty one and starts green, with every case, run and ledger row the release wrote invisible to it. No commit from before F219 is ever a rollback target. That code cannot be changed to refuse, and nothing newer can make it refuse, so this check is the only guard.

Then do one of these instead:

1. **Roll forward** (the default): fix the fault on top of the release and deploy that commit with the one command. The store, the ledger and the audit chain stay exactly as they are (invariant 6).
2. **Restore, then deploy the older commit against the restored copy**, when the data the release wrote must be abandoned as well. This is an owner's decision: everything written after the restore point stays only in the release's copy.
   - Restore into a new database, never over the live one (`docs/MIGRATIONS.md`). Use the custom-format backup `docs/MIGRATIONS.md` says to take before an upgrade, restored with `pg_restore` into a new, empty database. On Lakebase Autoscaling you can instead create a branch from a point in time before the release's first boot: Databricks describes point-in-time branching (`databricks postgres create-branch` with `spec.source_branch_time`) in the Lakebase skill this repository carries, `.claude/skills/databricks-lakebase/SKILL.md`. Nothing in this repository has exercised either path against a real workspace.
   - Bind the older commit to that copy through the one command's own values: `LAKEBASE_BRANCH` and `LAKEBASE_ENDPOINT` for a restored branch and its read-write endpoint, or `LAKEBASE_DATABASE` (with `--provisioned`) for a restored Provisioned database. E1 looks a branch's endpoint and database up, E2 holds the bound branch and database to the values given, and E8 connects to the copy and names its version.
   - Row E6's `store` code `OK` on that deploy is the proof: the older code verified the restored store's migration history at boot and accepted it. Apply `docs/MIGRATIONS.md`'s blob check to the restored copy: every digest it references must still read back from the volume.

## 7. Operating notes

- The app is `caos` in the `prod` target only. In `dev` it is `caos-dev-<user id>`, each developer's own app (an app name is unique in the workspace, and the numeric SCIM id keeps to the Apps name rule of lowercase letters, digits and hyphens), and in any other target `caos-<target>` (DP-6, DF-5). A target added later therefore never deploys over the production app; the one command's E5 row looks up the name E2 resolved, and E2 fails if a target other than `prod` resolves to `caos`.
- Preflight refuses an endpoint that logs payloads (an AI Gateway inference table, the legacy auto-capture, or a `telemetry_config` inference table that is named or samples any request), that exports logs or traces through `telemetry_config` (metrics alone are fine), that falls back to another model, or that serves more than one entity; the same rules are applied to an update still pending on the endpoint (DP-3, DF-3). Every prompt carries document text, and the host prices one model per endpoint. Guardrails are reported, not refused.
- A deploy of the `prod` target that was interrupted leaves its lock at `/Workspace/caos-bundle/prod/state/deploy.lock`, and the next `bundle deploy` (E3) stops and names the lock's holder. Ask that person whether a deploy is still running; only when none is, rerun with `databricks bundle deploy --force-lock` (DF-12).
- CLI 1.17.0 panics during `bundle deploy` (a Go stack trace naming `OverrideChangeDesc`) when the app its state records was deleted outside the bundle and the release changes the app's configuration, a price rotation for instance (DF-13). Run `databricks bundle deployment unbind caos -t <target> -p <profile>` with the same variables, then deploy again: the deploy creates the app anew. Raise `databricks_cli_version` once a CLI release no longer panics.
- The Lakebase kind is the target's, and an app keeps the kind it was deployed with. Changing an existing app's database resource from one form to the other (a `prod-provisioned` app redeployed as `prod`, or the reverse) changes the Postgres role the app connects as, per the Databricks Apps documentation: the new role owns nothing in `caos_store` or `caos_graph`, so the app would not start (E6 `store`). Both production targets deploy the app `caos` from state of their own, so the second is refused as a taken name (DP-6) rather than silently rebinding it. A deliberate switch is an owner's decision and a DBA's: hand both schemas and everything in them to the new role first, then `databricks bundle deployment unbind caos -t <old target>` and `databricks bundle deployment bind caos caos -t <new target>` with the same variables, then deploy. None of this has been run against a real workspace.
- `PGSSLMODE=require` encrypts but does not authenticate the Lakebase server (MX-7). Where the workspace publishes a CA bundle, set `PGSSLMODE=verify-full` and `PGSSLROOTCERT` in the bundle's `config.env`; libpq reads both.
- The gateway smoke (E7) makes two paid calls outside the budget ledger (AI-8): a documented exception, once per deploy.
- E9 and E10 leave one governed case behind per deploy, titled `CAOS deployment check (safe to archive)` so an operator who opens it recognises it at a glance: it exists only to prove the event stream delivers through the Apps proxy (E9) and that one model call through the app's own HTTP surface is answered by the gateway (E10, CF-054, W1), never through this script's process or credentials. It costs one tiny admitted source and one model call at the configured price, same as any other run. It is safe to leave in place (every later deploy makes its own) or for an admin to archive; nothing reads it back.

- The worker runs inside the app process (one run at a time). A queued run waits while the app restarts; leases expire and the run is reclaimed.
- Secrets: the app reads none. Model calls use the service principal's OAuth; Lakebase credentials are minted per connection and never logged.
- Logs never carry document text: refusals are typed codes (`caos/refusals.py`).
- To rotate the model: change `model_endpoint` and `model_price` together and redeploy. Every run is pinned at creation to its model and that model's dated price (0043, F468): it finishes on them while the deployment still approves the model (as `model_endpoint` or in `model_choices`), and parks `PROVIDER_NOT_CONFIGURED` before its next call once it does not, rather than moving to another model part way through. To let running runs finish on the old model, keep it in `model_choices` for one release. A run started before 0043 has no pin and runs on whatever the deployment configures.

## 8. Before the workspace exists: the loopback stand-in

`tests/workspace_stub.py` (D28) answers, on `127.0.0.1`, every workspace path this repository's code and the CLI use, so the whole chain can be exercised with no profile:

```bash
uv run python tests/workspace_stub.py -- databricks bundle validate -t dev \
  --var uc_catalog=main --var uc_schema=caos --var lakebase_project=caos
uv run python tests/workspace_stub.py -- databricks bundle validate -t dev-provisioned \
  --var uc_catalog=main --var uc_schema=caos --var lakebase_instance=caos-lb
CAOS_REQUIRE_POSTGRES=1 uv run pytest --no-cov tests/test_workspace_stub.py
```

The first two end with `Validation OK!` and list the paths the CLI asked for (`bundle deploy` and `bundle run caos` pass the same way; the `prod` and `prod-provisioned` targets, deployment lock and all, run their validate, deploy and run under one stub each with `sh -c` (A37); the stub holds one Lakebase of each kind, the Autoscaling project `caos` with its `production` branch, `primary` endpoint and `databricks-postgres` database, and the Provisioned instance `caos-lb`, answers the Postgres API's project, endpoint, database and credential calls, and refuses an app whose database resource names a Lakebase it does not hold, as the Apps API does at create; the stub answers a taken app name with 409, a name outside the Apps rule with 400 and a write that would replace a held lock with 409, keeps each deployment's command and environment, and serves `workspace/export` as the platform does; and `scripts/check_gate_config.py --shipped .databricks/bundle/dev/deployment.json` then checks that what the deploy synced holds every tracked file under the sync roots and every file of the built export, so build the export first). Each stand-in run is a new, empty workspace, so a `bundle` command under the stub first clears the bundle state an earlier stand-in run left in `.databricks/bundle`, and refuses to run over state a real workspace wrote (DF-13). The stub is the only workspace a stand-in run can reach: it refuses `-p`/`--profile` in any spelling (R24-02, N1) and a bundle that names a workspace `host`, `profile`, `auth_type`, client id or other credential of its own, or includes other files (CLI 1.17.0 prefers a bundle's own host to `DATABRICKS_HOST`, W7), and it hands the CLI no inherited `DATABRICKS_*`, `ARM_*` or `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` variable; `scripts/check_gate_config.py` refuses the same keys in the committed `databricks.yml`. The last runs the gateway smoke, `scripts/preflight.py` for both kinds, SCIM identity, the volume backend, the Lakebase checkpointer on either kind's credential and a LITE route through `ChatDatabricks` over HTTP. `tests/test_platform_boot.py` goes further: it boots `python -m caos.serve` under the platform's own environment against the stub and the Docker Postgres, bound to each kind in turn, and drives a governed run through the HTTP surface to COMPLETE; `tests/test_enterprise_deploy.py` runs the one command of section 3 against that, with and without `--provisioned`. What the stand-in cannot tell you: whether the workspace grants what the bundle asks for, what the platform injects for a `postgres` resource and whether it provisions the app's role on it as it does for a `database` resource, how its Apps proxy treats the event stream (C42), the Lakebase major version (D17), or what a real model answers. The one command reports each of those the first time it runs there; the instruction for that run is `docs/rebuild/ENTERPRISE_HANDOFF.md`.

`tests/shipped_boot.py` goes one step further than the platform test: it deploys the `dev` target through the stub, reads the files the CLI synced back out of the stub, boots `python -m caos.serve` in that tree rather than in this checkout, waits for every health code to read `OK`, and completes one governed LITE run through `ChatDatabricks` (CF-001). CI's `bundle` job runs it.

### Where the stand-in and the platform differ

Every known gap between the loopback stand-in and a real workspace, what the stand-in does instead, and the row of the one command (section 3) that shows the real answer the first time it runs there.

| Gap | What the stand-in does | Shown by |
|---|---|---|
| Presigned downloads (CF-095) | Nothing to stand in for: every workspace client is built with `disable_experimental_files_api_client=True` (F237), so the blob backend uses the plain Files API the stub serves and never asks for a presigned URL. Unproven: that the workspace's Files API answers the same shapes. | E6 `blobs`, then E10's blob write through the app |
| OAuth machine-to-machine (N7) | Answers the SDK's discovery and token routes for placeholder client credentials (F248) and checks neither. Unproven: that the platform hands the app a working service principal. | E6 `identity` and `store`, E10 |
| 429s, and output-token limits against `max_tokens` (CF-009) | Never answers 429 and applies no limit; the provider's resend and deadline rules are tested in-process only (`tests/test_models.py`). An endpoint limiting output tokens per minute may refuse a request whose `max_tokens` exceeds it. | E7 (two calls), E10 (the app's own call parks `PROVIDER_*` with the code) |
| Lakebase grants and the migration role (CF-010, OD-5) | Mints a credential for the Docker Postgres; `tests/test_platform_boot.py` boots on the bundle's grant alone (CONNECT and CREATE, DL-1), and `tests/test_health.py` and `tests/test_store_schema.py` refuse a store schema another role owns (F364). Unproven: whether the workspace provisions the app's role, and what it injects for a `postgres` resource (D49). A migration role the runtime cannot assume is the enterprise DBA's (N16). | E6 `store`, E8 |
| `forward_user_access_token` (CF-033) | Echoes what the bundle sent, so the flag reads as deployed; a workspace without the preview answers `False`. | E5 |
| The Apps proxy and the event stream (C42) | No proxy stands between a test and the app, so neither buffering nor an idle cut can happen. | E9 |
| The app's own model call (N82) | Answers with the fixtures' valid handoffs; no real model has answered through E10 yet. | E10 |
| The platform's install of Python and the lock (B7) | A test runs this checkout's `.venv`; how the platform treats `.python-version` is undocumented. | E6 `python_version` |
| The Lakebase major version (D17, B5) | `postgres:17-alpine`. | E8 |
| Nested group membership (B9) | SCIM `Me` answers exactly the groups a test lists; nested groups are not expanded on the platform either, so members must be direct (section 1). | E9's `unverified` for a deployer outside both groups |
