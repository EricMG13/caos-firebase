"""Build hygiene: facts about the files that build and ship this, asserted here.

A job with no timeout can hold a runner for six hours on a hung step, and two
runs of one branch racing each other report whichever finished last. Both are
facts about the CI file, so both are asserted against that file itself.

The Dockerfile is here for the same reason and was not, which is the gap: it is
the other place this repository installs packages and the only one whose result
ships, and no gate read it. `check_tested.py` reads Python; Trivy answers "are
the installed packages known-vulnerable", never "was this build hashed,
wheels-only, digest-pinned and unprivileged".
