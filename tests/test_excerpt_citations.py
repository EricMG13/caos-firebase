"""D105 (owner, 4 October 2026: "you do not need to display the entire line
verbatim. just allow the user the ability to trace where a statement or
conclusion was derived from"): an answer's citation is an exact excerpt of one
evidence line -- at least `MIN_EXCERPT_WORDS` consecutive whole words of it, or
the whole line when it is shorter -- found once on its page and anchored to that
line, which the record keeps beside the quote (`AnchoredCitation.line_text`).

A record accepted under an earlier rule names it and is re-anchored by it
(`tests/test_whole_line_citations.py`), so nothing stored moves.
