"""Phase 3 exit tests: the phase the predecessor got wrong.

Route resolution read `navigation.dependencies` -- 97 untyped pairs meant for display --
instead of `profile["edges"]`. The consequences were exact: 25 OPTIONAL and 22
ADVISORY edges were enforced as mandatory, the single QA_GATE did not gate, and
RESTRICTED could not occur at all.

Every test here reads the vendored catalog rather than a fixture, so the numbers
are the build's own (`tests/test_bundle_pin.py` pins them). The soft-edge rule is
the one worth stating twice: OPTIONAL and ADVISORY degrade a target to RESTRICTED
-- which runs and carries its limitation forward -- unless the edge's source
module is READY or READY_WITH_LIMITATIONS in the accepted CP-0 artifact, at which
point the evidence exists and the edge blocks.

Readiness is read from that artifact and never passed in: a caller that could
assert readiness could assert its way past the gate that exists to measure it.

    The catalog-based test above cannot distinguish route order from

    `nodes` puts "B" before "A" while `edges` declares A's edge first and
