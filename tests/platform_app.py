"""The process a Databricks App runs, started the way the platform starts it.

`python -m caos.serve` in a subprocess with the platform's environment: the
app name and port, `PG*` for the database resource, the workspace host and
a bearer, the volume blob root, the gateway endpoint and price, the run
ceiling, the in-process worker, the static export, and the one Lakebase the
target binds (an Autoscaling endpoint by default, or a Provisioned instance;
R24-14). The workspace is the loopback stub (D28) and the database is the
test Postgres, reached through the credential the stub mints for that
kind -- so `store_url()`, the migrations, the health probes, identity, the
worker and the volume backend all run as they would behind the Apps proxy,
with nothing injected below HTTP.
