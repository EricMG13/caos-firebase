"""R2.6 held by the ledger, not by the park alone (F589), and R2.2's credit
price held by the run, not the environment (F592), through the worker.

A Copilot call charged above its reservation is recorded in full, refused
`BUDGET_CHARGE_OVER_RESERVATION`, and its run parks for good. The park is a
separate write from the refusal's explanation: a worker that dies, or a store
that fails, between the two leaves the run claimed and unparked. The next
claim must still start no attempt on that pin -- the pinned per-token price
would reserve the same way and the AI-unit bill overshoot the same way -- so
the ledger itself refuses it, under the run lock, and the reclaim parks the
run with the same code. Turned from the adversarial audit's probes
(`test_p2_park_crash_window.py`, `test_p2b_park_store_fault.py`).
