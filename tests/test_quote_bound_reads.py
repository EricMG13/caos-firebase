"""NB2 review, Important 1: a stored quote longer than the wire's bound never
fails a read with a validation error (INTERNAL_FAULT).

The reviewer's probe is a 70,011-character quote. As an unverified quote it
can no longer be stored (NB1's cap: longer than any evidence line,
`HANDOFF_MALFORMED`) and a record holding one does not decode, so every read
and the save boundary answer the record's typed refusal. As an anchored
quote -- an `ANY_RUN` quote is any run of its page, and the codec bounds no
quote's length -- it decodes, and every read serves it cut at `QUOTE_CHARS`,
ending "…(truncated)" (`wire.bounded`).
