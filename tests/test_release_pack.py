"""The release pack: emitted from the suite, the tree and the store, never typed.

Two things are asked of it, and each has a test here. "The release pack
reproduces without editing a checksum"
is byte equality between two emissions over one tree, one of them from a fresh
interpreter so that nothing an in-process cache or a hash seed decides can
leak into the bytes. "Every advertised pathway has a current verdict or is
disabled and says so" is the pathway table, and the half of it that matters
most is the negative one: no pathway reads QUALIFIED unless a signed
`qualification_verdicts` row, current at the moment the caller names and bound
