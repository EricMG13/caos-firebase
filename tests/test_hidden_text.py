"""N27: PDF text a reader of the rendered page does not see, kept and marked.

pdfminer lays out every glyph a content stream shows, so text drawn in render
mode 3 -- neither filled nor stroked, and the text layer every OCR'd scan
carries over its image -- text painted in the colour behind it, glyphs under
2 pt, text inside optional content the document switches off and text the
page paints over later were admitted as ordinary evidence with nothing to
tell an approver or a model that no reader of the page sees them. They stay
evidence, because a scan's only text is its invisible layer; each line
carrying one is marked with why, the approver reads the mark on the page
read, and the model is told in the header over the page's marked lines, never
on a line it quotes (C1). The text stays citable, and anchoring is unchanged.
