"""Per-node evidence selection from CP-0's T8 `Source files to attach` (§95).

The gate's accepted row for a consumer names the pinned sources it is to be
handed; the host maps the names to members and delivers only their blocks, so
a quote of an unnamed pinned source is refused `CITATION_NOT_DELIVERED` on a
real run shape for the first time. A row the host cannot read as a selection
delivers the whole pin, as every run before; a half-readable row refuses before
any attempt. The rule is pure over pinned inputs, so every reader selects alike.
