"""The canonical executor: one call, billing first, then a validated handoff and
its host record, or a typed refusal (Task 3.1 slice c-5a; §41, §42).

The claims path's guarantees carry over unchanged -- the attempt, the stored
identity and the upstream are rechecked after transport -- and three are new:
the Markdown is the vendor's conforming handoff for exactly this invocation,
every citation anchors or the whole handoff is refused, and every answer's
exact response body is addressed as the call's diagnostic before analysis.
