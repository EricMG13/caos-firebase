"""One verification reader behind the proof, the deliverable and the runtime.

Invariants 3, 4 and 11 all pass through the ten-step check of an accepted
artifact. Three readers each ran their own copy and had drifted; now each is a
call site of `verify_accepted` that differs only in whether it re-anchors
(§42.4: the runtime does not), whether it re-reads authority bytes past the
digest cache, and which code it answers at each step.
