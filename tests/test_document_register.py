"""The gate that keeps the document register honest about what the sets name.

A qualification set is the only thing in this tree that pins evidence, and the
register is the only place that says where that evidence came from and what is
still to be sourced. A set that names a document the register does not list is
a provenance hole, so it is a failure rather than a note.
