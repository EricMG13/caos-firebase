"""A canonical route through the real runtime (Task 3.1 slice c-5b; §41, §42).

`run_route` accepts a canonical result with its host record, replays the
executor's diagnostic exactly, reads CP-0 readiness and QA from records
verified against their Markdown, and ends the run BLOCKED on a validated
Blocked handoff. The post-call freshness guarantees are proven here too
(their claims-adapter variants were removed with the claims route in f-1a).
