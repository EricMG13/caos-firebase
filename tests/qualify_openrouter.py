"""Drive `scripts/qualify.py` through the test-only OpenRouter adapter (spec 3.4).

Production qualification runs through the gateway provider `from_environment`
builds. Before a workspace exists, the only model that can answer is the one
OpenRouter serves, and OpenRouter lives under `tests/` alone, so this wrapper
hands the driver a provider built from the adapter and otherwise runs it
unchanged: same store, same blobs, same ceilings, same proof.

    OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... CAOS_MODEL_ENDPOINT=anthropic/claude-opus-5 \\
    CAOS_MODEL_PRICE=anthropic/claude-opus-5,0.000005,0.000025,2026-09-23 \\
    CAOS_QUALIFY_POSTGRES_URL=... CAOS_QUALIFY_BLOB_ROOT=... \\
    uv run python tests/qualify_openrouter.py qualification/ccl-fy2025 \\
        --expect-identity openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-5/none/65536 --ceiling 14.00

`OPENROUTER_REASONING_EFFORT` and `OPENROUTER_PROVIDER` (F479) add an effort and
a provider pin, and the identity then names them (see `openrouter_adapter`).
The identity names OpenRouter, never the gateway: a verdict measured here is
not gateway coverage (AR-22), and the key is read by the adapter at call time
and never stored or printed.
