"""A register row a cell short or long is named to the guided retry (F509).

Live run LCR4: CP-3C was refused four times on "T3D.2 row 8: critical column
'Source Trace' holds a disqualifying placeholder ''". The row had 11 cells
under a 12-cell header; the vendor padded it, so its source text sat in
Credit Implication and the model, which saw that text in the row, kept it.

Live run LCR6 (F522): told "T3D.2 row 7 has 11 cells", the model rewrote that
row's text three times and kept it 11 wide. The line now names the row by its
first cell and quotes how its last columns read, so the shift is visible.

Fork r13 (D111, N154): the vendor's own line for the padded cell now names the
row's cell count against the header's too; the host line still leads, and
alone covers a short row that empties no critical cell and a long row.
