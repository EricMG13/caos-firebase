"""Tokens carry where they were, and a region is what a quote may not leave.

Matching joins tokens within a line and continues only onto the next line of
the same region, so a quote cannot be assembled across a column gutter -- the
two columns are different regions and the phrase never forms. Everything
invariant 11 refuses rests on the region boundary being drawn here, at
extraction, by whatever produced the tokens.
