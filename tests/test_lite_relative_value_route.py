"""The contract test for `LITE_CREDIT_22 / LITE_RELATIVE_VALUE` (CP-0 ->
CP-L10 -> CP-1C), Completion Phase 9 Task 9.2.

Three nodes, three REQUIRED edges, `decision_scope: SCREENING_ONLY`. CP-1C is
a FULL module held behind the named-LITE-object boundary until CP-L10's
`lite_financial_change_screen` is accepted (§46.1); its own contract under
the LITE identity is `tests/test_lite_cp1c_contract.py`. What is proven here
is the pathway: it completes, proves and freezes; its requests fit the request
ceiling; a CP-L10 that is blocked -- by CP-0's verdict or by its own validated
answer -- holds CP-1C with nothing attempted, reserved or called; and a
Restricted CP-L10's limitation reaches CP-1C's prompt and the deliverable.

Every provider is deterministic; no live call is made.
