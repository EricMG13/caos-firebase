"""F468: a run is started on one approved model and executes on it or not at all.

The deployment approves its models (`CAOS_MODEL_PRICE` and
`CAOS_MODEL_CHOICES`), a new run is pinned to one of them at its dated price,
and the worker builds each run's provider from that pin -- so a redeploy that
changes the configured model no longer moves a running run onto another.
