"""Phase 2: bytes enter a case one way, and the whole pack enters or none of it.

Ingestion is the only way bytes enter a case, web discovery is structurally
absent, and a pack is admitted or refused in one transaction. Invariant 1 is
that runs execute against pinned sources; a pack that half-landed is a source
set nobody pinned.

The block shape is the other subject here. The predecessor measured
excessive I/O from evidence blocks that lived in one JSON column, so every
`read_evidence` parsed every block of a source. Blocks are one row each,
keyed by `(source_id, block_id)`, and `test_a_block_is_one_row_not_a_column`
is what stops that coming back.
