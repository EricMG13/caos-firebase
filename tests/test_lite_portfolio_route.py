"""The contract test for `LITE_CREDIT_22 / LITE_PORTFOLIO_DECISION` (CP-0 ->
CP-L10), the pathway `CLAUDE.md`'s ledger recorded as enabled nowhere because
no contract test proved it.

Two nodes and one REQUIRED edge, `decision_scope: SCREENING_ONLY`, and CP-L10
is the terminal deliverable. Nothing here is new machinery: the route runs
through the same `run_route` -> `ModuleProvider` -> canonical executor ->
vendor validators -> proof -> canonical deliverable path
`tests/test_lite_route_e2e_positive.py` drives for the earnings pathway, over
the same vendor-derived handoffs (`tests/lite_route_fixtures.py`). What is
proven is the pathway: it completes, proves and freezes; its requests fit the
request ceiling; a CP-0 verdict that blocks CP-L10 stops the run before any
further call; and a validated Blocked CP-L10 -- the route's *terminal* -- ends
the run BLOCKED and is recorded as the verdict that did.

CP-L10's owned object `lite_financial_change_screen` has no consumer on this
two-node route, so `named_objects` holds no accepted-object boundary here
(§46.1) and CP-L10 is held by nothing but CP-0's own readiness verdict.

Every provider is deterministic; no live call is made.
