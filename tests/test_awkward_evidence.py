"""One deliberately awkward document, through the paths that admit and read it.

Four of the six defects this file arrived with failed the same way: *the test
wrote the fixture, so the test could not see the assumption the fixture
encoded*. Every citation fixture in the suite used `page=1`, because every
fixture document was under sixty lines. Every extraction fixture separated its
words with spaces. Every ingestion fixture was short and clean.

So this fixture is awkward on purpose -- a tab-separated table row, a
non-breaking space, runs of spaces, a blank line, and enough lines that the
quote a module is asked to find sits on page two. It is driven through the real
`admit_pack`, the real `read_block` and the real `verify_citations`, and the
property it asserts is the one the system actually promises: **text this
repository delivered can be quoted back to it, and the rectangle comes back.**

A unit test for each of those four steps would pass on a clean fixture and say
nothing about this one. The value here is the whole round trip over input
nobody would have chosen.
