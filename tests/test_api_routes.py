"""The two request paths: the run document, the tail over a socket, and privacy.

The run endpoint serves node states with their reasons, and the one QA_GATE
reads as a gate. The one QA_GATE in the catalog is
`CP-5 -> CP-6`, and a node held by it is not in the same situation as a node held
by an ordinary REQUIRED edge: one is waiting for a person, the other for a
module. A surface that rendered both as "BLOCKED" would leave a reviewer with no
way to see that the run is waiting on them.

`test_unauthorised_case_is_private_404` is the second of a matched pair. The
first, identity derivation, is in `tests/test_actor_matrix.py`.
