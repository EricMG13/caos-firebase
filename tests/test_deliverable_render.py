"""Phase 8 exit: the page renders from frozen bytes and nothing else.

`test_the_deliverable_renders_from_the_frozen_payload_alone` is one of three
tests for this exit. The render *originates nothing*: it is a function of
frozen bytes, so there is no editorial boundary to police.

A test that rendered with a live connection to hand would pass whether or not
that were true, so this one closes the store first and renders from the payload
alone. The other two exit tests -- the filing chain and the audit package --
arrive with the chain they check.

The payload below is the canonical shape `render()` understands since the
claims render path was deleted (f-2a): one artifact
carries a Markdown handoff and its host record, each addressed by digest, in
place of the retired `module_id`/`claims` shape. `_artifact` builds one with
correct digests by hand -- standard library only, like the render itself.
