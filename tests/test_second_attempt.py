"""D30 (N32, the owner's choice; widened by N52 and, on 23 September 2026, to a
host-owned field copied wrong or a field no handoff may carry; D82 on 2 October
2026): a node whose answer is refused `HANDOFF_MALFORMED`, `HANDOFF_INCOMPLETE`,
`HANDOFF_IDENTITY_MISMATCH`, `HANDOFF_UNDECLARED_FIELD` or by anchoring gets a
guided retry, reserved and priced like any other, carrying what the checks
reported on the answer just before it -- at most three per node (D82's
amendment of 4 October 2026). The ledger decides it, so a crash between a
refusal and its retry changes nothing, and a fourth refusal stops the run.

The flawed answer is the one every live model gave (F111): CP-0 tags a finding
MATERIAL and still writes `qa_status: Passed`.
