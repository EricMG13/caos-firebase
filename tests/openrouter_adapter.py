"""The test-only OpenRouter adapter (spec section 3.4).

Only tests import this module. It builds a LangChain `ChatOpenAI` against
OpenRouter's OpenAI-compatible endpoint and hands it to the same
`caos.models.completions` seam production uses, so a live test drives the
real graph and the real executor with the only difference being who answers.
The key is read from the environment at call time and never stored; only
synthetic or public fixtures may travel through it (never client data); and
nothing here counts as gateway coverage.

Two optional names, read at call time, shape the request (F479). With neither
set the request is the one this module always sent. `OPENROUTER_REASONING_EFFORT`
(`minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high` or `xhigh`) sends `reasoning: {"effort": ...}`;
`OPENROUTER_PROVIDER` (a comma-separated list of provider names or endpoint
tags such as `openai/flex`) sends `provider: {"order": [...], "allow_fallbacks":
false}`, so a call never lands on a host that was not named. Both travel in the
`ChatOpenAI` `extra_body`. Production never sends an effort (N2, AR-15); this is
test-only.

The identity a verdict binds is one plain string, so `qualify.py
--expect-identity` stays a string compare: `openrouter/<model>/<effort>/<max
tokens>`, with `none` as the effort when none is sent, and `openrouter/<model>@
<order>/<effort>/<max tokens>` when a provider pin is set, `<order>` the
pinned names joined by `,`. For example `openrouter/openai/gpt-6-luna/high/65536`
and `openrouter/openai/gpt-6-luna-pro@openai/flex/none/65536`.
