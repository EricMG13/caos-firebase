"""N28 (CF-016, D39 "Host enforces whole lines"): a citation accepted with an
answer is one whole evidence line as the module was shown it.

The final check tells a module that `matched_text` is "the complete text of one
evidence line" and that the line appears exactly once on its cited page. The
host used to accept any unique run of tokens, so a fragment that dropped a
"not" anchored and reached the committee page as a host-verified source fact
(AI-4, `docs/rebuild/findings-round2.md`). An answer is now held to the rule it
was given (`WHOLE_LINE`), while a record accepted before is re-anchored by the
rule it was accepted under (`ANY_RUN`), which it names.
