"""Phase 6: authority is checked where the commit is, and the audit chains.

Authority has to be checked at commit time, and a check at the request is not
that. The distance between them is a real window: a request arrives, standing
is checked, work happens, the actor's membership is revoked, and the commit
lands anyway. So the check lives inside the store call that writes.

The audit rule is the other half. A governed write commits its state and its
audit event in one transaction -- or neither. `audit_events` is hash-chained
per case under an `audit_chain_heads` lock row, so a rewrite is detectable by
comparing a retained head against the live one.

Two of the tests here: `test_membership_revocation_refuses_commit`, and the
Phase 1 debt Phase 6 owes, `test_a_governed_write_commits_its_audit_event_or_nothing`.
