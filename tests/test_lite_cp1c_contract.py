"""CP-1C under a LITE identity: the FULL module's contract on
`LITE_CREDIT_22 / LITE_RELATIVE_VALUE` (Completion Phase 9 Task 9.2).

CP-1C "remains a FULL run when the run profile is `LITE_CREDIT_22`" and
retains `NAMED_LITE_OBJECT_ACCEPTED` for `lite_financial_change_screen`
(its verified `SKILL.md`). Nothing about its registers changes with the
profile; what changes is the scope the host projects beside its status
(`SCREENING_ONLY`, from the catalog pathway) and the upstream it may read:
CP-0's and CP-L10's accepted records, CP-L10's under the edge's catalog
`allowed_use: SCREENING_ONLY`.

The five owner-contract tests of `tests/test_owner_contracts.py` are repeated
here for both consumers of this route under its own identity, and two tests
name the route's boundary: CP-1C accepts the named object and keeps the
screening scope, and CP-1C is held -- never attempted, reserved or called --
until CP-L10 is accepted. Every provider is deterministic.
