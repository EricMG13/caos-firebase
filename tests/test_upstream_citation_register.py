"""The upstream verified-citation register (Phase 3 Task 3.3 slice 3.3d).

A consumer's prompt carries, beside each direct upstream's exact Markdown, the
citations the host anchored when that upstream was accepted: host-owned
context proving each quote exists in evidence delivered to that module, and
saying nothing about whether it supports anything (CP-5's audit). Neither the
upstream text nor this register is evidence: a quote found only there is
refused. Only accepted artifacts reach a consumer; a Blocked or refused
attempt's body never does, and a disclosed conflict and every mandatory
register pass through byte for byte.
