"""The contract test for `LITE_CREDIT_22 / LITE_DEEP_RESEARCH` (CP-0 -> CP-DR).

Two nodes and one REQUIRED edge, `decision_scope: SCREENING_ONLY`, CP-DR the
terminal deliverable (§96). The pinned brief reaches CP-DR's identity bound to
the run, the accepted CP-0 and the bundle; its front matter carries the
research fields the vendor's own preparer emits; its prompt carries the bound
brief as a tagged host-owned section; its handoff is judged by the vendor's
`validate_text`, `completeness_check` and `validate_dossier`. The route runs
through the same `run_route` -> `ModuleProvider` -> canonical executor ->
vendor validators -> proof -> canonical deliverable path every enabled pathway
uses: it completes, proves and freezes over a two-document pack; its requests
fit the request ceiling; a CP-0 verdict that blocks CP-DR stops the run before
any further call.

The pathway was dead as authored until build `6a5f1050`: the bundle's
`parse_t8` refused the CP-DR row CP-0's own contract asks for. Every
provider is deterministic; no live call is made.
