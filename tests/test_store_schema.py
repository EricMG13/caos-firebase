"""Phase 1: the store applies the schema it declares, and says so when it cannot.

The Postgres schema must apply in full at startup. The failure that invites
is `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` over a database an older build created: every
statement succeeds, the missing column is never mentioned, and the first
write to it fails in production instead of at boot. So startup records which
declared schema it applied and refuses a database that was built from a
different one.

Invariant protected: PostgreSQL owns everything transactional, and what it
owns is the declared shape rather than whatever the first deployment
happened to create.
