"""The Analysis section read (Phase 4 Task 4.1, slice 4.1e).

Every accepted handoff of the displayed run, in route order, read through
`accepted_handoff` -- the record bound to its Markdown and to the identity the
store rebuilds, no re-anchoring (§42.4) -- and labelled per §46.3: host-verified
source facts, model-authored analysis, and no host calculation. Unaccepted
nodes make the document partial. The case is the authorisation resource; a
run of another case is the same `RUN_NOT_FOUND` as an unknown one.
