"""A line wider than a block, through the paths that admit and cite it.

Blocks pack one per line while small, and bounded line groups once not,
splitting a line at the group width rather than giving it a block of its
own. The width is not a free parameter: `source_blocks.text` is
`BoundaryText`, so a block can carry `boundary_text.DEFAULT_LIMIT` characters
and no more, and a line past that refused the whole pack -- one wide table row
in a text export and no document of it could be admitted at all.

The property these tests hold is the one splitting must not cost: a document
whose lines fit is numbered exactly as it was before there was any splitting,
because `source_blocks` rows are immutable and stored citations name ids that
already exist.
