"""Phase 4: no provider call without a reservation, and every ceiling fails closed.

Invariant 8 (CLAUDE.md): budgets fail closed. Every ceiling refuses the next
operation *before* overspend, and no provider call happens without a reservation
behind it.

The attempt row is
the call identity, and a retry is a new reservation rather than a reuse of the
old one. That is the price of a provider with no idempotency key, and it is
charged deliberately -- the alternative is a second call believed to be the first.

The reservation commits on its own, before the call. Sharing the acceptance
transaction would mean a crash after the provider completed rolled back the
record of money that was actually spent.
