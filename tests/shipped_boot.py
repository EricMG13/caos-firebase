"""The file set a stand-in deployment ships, booted the way the platform boots it.

`databricks bundle deploy` and `bundle run caos` go to the loopback workspace
(D28) the way `workspace_stub.py` runs them; then the bytes the CLI synced to
the app's source path -- read back from the stub, not from this checkout --
are written to a scratch directory, `python -m caos.serve` starts *there*
under the platform's environment and the deployment's own variables, every
health code must be `OK`, and one governed LITE run must complete through
`ChatDatabricks` over the stub (CF-001, N47). The boot from the repository
(`tests/test_platform_boot.py`) cannot tell a file the sync left out from one
the process never needed; this can.

`uv run python tests/shipped_boot.py` after `npm --prefix frontend run build`,
with `CAOS_TEST_POSTGRES_URL` naming a Postgres server this may create a
database on. CI's `bundle` job runs it, the job that has the CLI.
