"""The qualification set, its answer keys, and the matrix a reviewer reads.

A **qualification set** is the immutable cases and answer keys one verdict is
measured against (`CONTEXT.md`); its digest is one of the six bindings
`read_verdict` requires.
The matrix is what the host can put in front of a reviewer: per case, what it
could prove on its own, and which of that case's expected citations the run
actually produced.

The line this file exists to hold: **the matrix reports, it does not conclude.**
Comparing a run against an answer key is mechanical and the host may do it.
Deciding that the comparison is good enough is a reviewer's signature, and
`QUALIFIED` is their word -- so nothing here carries a verdict field, a pass
flag, or a score that reads as one. A row states what happened; the reviewer
reads the rows.

Which is also why a row survives its own failure. A matrix that stopped at the
first unprovable case would hand a reviewer less than it knew, and the first
question they would ask is what the other cases did.
