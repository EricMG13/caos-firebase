"""D107: the body cites by `[C<n>]` markers and quotes no source text.

The excerpt lives only in `citations` (D105). A marker names the citation at
its 1-based place in the list; `linked` now means a marker names it; a marker
naming no citation refuses the answer as malformed, told by its number; a
citation no marker names is kept, not linked to a statement, and never
refuses. Every citation accepted since D107 keeps its place (`marker`) in the
record, so a downstream reader can resolve a marker it reads in a body.
