# CZR Q2 2026 FULL liquidity qualification set — prepared offline

Status: **LIVE-RUN 2026-10-05 / NOT QUALIFIED (citation keys)**. Prepared offline; the live results are in the last section.

Corpus changed 2026-10-06, D115; earlier runs were on the old corpus. See "Corpus changed 2026-10-06 (D115)" below.

This immutable set prepares `FULL_CREDIT_32 / LIQUIDITY_REVIEW` for Caesars
Entertainment, Inc. (CZR) at an analysis date of 2026-10-02. Its
qualification-set digest is
`2f274851157840d674ec1308bb9337e1444379175be10bf9564d3a3edb362af0`.

## Corpus changed 2026-10-06 (D115)

On the owner's approval of 6 October 2026 (D115) exactly three files were downloaded from sec.gov (User-Agent declared on every request; the SEC's 111-byte script tag removed, so each size equals the filing index's) and admitted. They were converted with the F498 converter (sentence per line, F492; clause split for the Merger Agreement, F498). **Every live run, verdict and snapshot recorded below was made on the old corpus and is not comparable with a run of this set as it now stands**; the set digest above is the new one.

| document | source | accession | text SHA-256 | raw HTML SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CZR_2026_Merger_Agreement.txt` (Ex. 2.1 to the 8-K of 28 May 2026, Agreement and Plan of Merger, 27 May 2026) | https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1590895/000119312526242995/d143382dex21.htm | 0001193125-26-242995 | `e01077c1ed37c5b08c4d2dbfc15da19b78d50b4b38a42e3da22c3cf0e4c3038c` | `fcc680b30487f2abd9d753125e09a0844b05285ddb718f1c43428b2ab60fff1b` |

Text bytes: `CZR_2026_Merger_Agreement.txt` 411,229. None is over 500 KiB as text, so no large-file pin moves; none is near the 1.5 MiB page-map threshold. The set's CP-0 request, encoded with CP-0's delivered authority, is 2,360,708 bytes (56.3% of `MAX_REQUEST_BYTES`); no source is shown as a page map.

The Merger Agreement is the full agreement beside the 8-K's summary where the set carries it. Schedules are omitted under Item 601(b)(2) and the debt commitment letters are not in this exhibit, so a claim about commitment-letter terms stays unsupported. No key is added: every existing key binds its own document and is unchanged.

## Corpus provenance

Each document is an official SEC EDGAR filing or exhibit, fetched on
2 October 2026 and converted from HTML to plain text the same day; the first
three are byte-identical to the `czr-2026q2` set's copies. The text SHA-256 is
the digest the keys bind; the raw SHA-256 is the HTML as fetched.

| document | source | accession | text SHA-256 | raw HTML SHA-256 |

Incremental Assumption Agreement No. 3 is 1,077,810 bytes: over 500 KiB, so its
path is pinned in the large-file excludes, but under 1.5 MiB, so it reaches
CP-0 whole rather than as a page map. All four are inside `MAX_REQUEST_BYTES`.
The exhibits F508 adds were fetched from SEC EDGAR on 5 October 2026 and
converted the same day, split by sentence (F492) and by clause (F498); they are
byte-identical to the `czr-2026q2-covenant-refinancing` set's copies. Since
F508 the conformed copy in its Exhibit A replaces the 2020 credit agreement
(Ex. 10.1, accession 0001193125-20-196232, 935,517 bytes). The set's CP-0
request, encoded with CP-0's delivered authority, is 1,927,280 bytes (45.9% of
`MAX_REQUEST_BYTES`, up from 1,778,362), and no source is shown as a page map.

## Why the pack carries the current legal chain (F508)

Live runs C5 (`czr-2026q2-covenant-refinancing`) and LCR1
(`czr-2026q2-lite-covenant-refinancing`) held back the covenant modules at CP-0
(CP-4, then CP-L10): the sets carried the 2020 credit agreement with only its
Fourth and Fifth Amendments, and the 6.50% 2032 notes indenture without its
supplemental indentures, though the FY2025 10-K's exhibit index lists them. On
the owner's ruling of 5 October 2026 ("Latest chain only"), every CZR set now
carries the exhibits beside the instrument each modifies; this set, which held
the credit agreement but not the indenture, carries Incremental Assumption
Agreement No. 3 in its place.

Incremental Assumption Agreement No. 3 (6 February 2024) adds the
`$2,900.0 million` Incremental Term B-1 Loans. Its Exhibit A is the credit
agreement conformed through Incremental Assumption Agreement No. 1, the First
to Third Amendments and Incremental Assumption Agreements No. 2 and No. 3; with
the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, which this set does not carry, it is the
current chain, and where Exhibit A and a later amendment differ, the later
amendment governs. Exhibit A comes without the credit agreement's own exhibits
and schedules: after its Annex A Pricing Grid the file goes straight to
Agreement No. 3's own Exhibit B, a form of solvency certificate. Exhibit A is a
changed copy, Agreement No. 3's insertions double-underlined and its deletions
struck through. On the owner's ruling of 5 October 2026 the text renders the
agreement as amended: every struck run from Exhibit A's cover on is removed
with its content (295 runs, 167 of them with text, 484 characters: superseded
table-of-contents page numbers and 38 words, labels or punctuation) and the
insertions are kept as plain text, with the spacing the filing renders once a
run is gone (one space restored where a run carried the only space between two
words, three places; none left before closing punctuation, three places), so
`Section 2.01(e)` and `Section 2.11(a)(iv)` read as amended. The one struck run
before the cover, the word `strikethrough` in the Agreement's own Section 3
legend, deletes nothing and is kept.

No key is added or changed. On the owner's ruling of 5 October 2026 ("Replace
the 2020 base"), the conformed copy replaces the 2020 credit agreement (Ex.
10.1, accession 0001193125-20-196232), which this set no longer carries: the
agreement as amended is the one in force, and the superseded 2020 text cost
about 0.9 MB of every request. No key here bound it.

## Keys

Keys authored from the documents; material figures pending owner confirmation.

- CP-1: the 10-Q's cash and cash equivalents, `$965` / `$887` million at
  30 June 2026 / 31 December 2025; and its Note 6 total debt, `11,807` face
  and `11,705` book at 30 June 2026, `11,792` book at 31 December 2025.
- CP-2: the 10-Q's six-month operating cash flow, `675` / `680` million, and
  purchase of property and equipment, `(335)` / `(453)` million.
- CP-2D: the release's CEI Revolving Credit Facility capacity net of
  outstanding balance, `2,130` million at 30 June 2026; the 10-Q's CEI
  Revolving Credit Facility row (2028 maturity, `$120` million face and book
  at 30 June 2026, `$160` million book at 31 December 2025); the 10-Q's annual
  maturities of long-term debt, `$55` / `$114` / `$767` / `$1,574` / `$3,962`
  / `$5,335` million for the rest of 2026, 2027–2030 and thereafter, totalling
  `$11,807` million; and the 10-Q's statement that the CEI Credit Agreement,
  as amended, provides for a `$2.25 billion` CEI Revolving Credit Facility
  maturing on 31 January 2028, and its next sentence, the `$388` million
  letter-of-credit sub-facility and `$40` million of reserves (each keyed as
  its whole Note 6 sentence; F475, F492).

The credit agreement carries no key. Since F508 it is the conformed copy in
Incremental Assumption Agreement No. 3's Exhibit A, which replaces the 2020
text; the Fourth (9 May 2024) and Fifth (25 November 2024) Amendments are not
in this set and post-date it, so the current commitment is keyed to the 10-Q;
the agreement is admitted for the facility's controlling terms. Since F498 its
sentences over 400 characters are cut further at their clause boundaries
(`; (b)`, `, (b)`, `; and`, `, and (c)`, `; provided`, `, provided that`,
`: (a)`); no key moves with them.

Alternative lines (D101). A figure key is also met by another whole evidence
line, cited under the same module, that states the key's lead figures -- the
current figure and the comparative the key line leads with -- for the same
measure, period and consolidated scope; a % change, a further period or a third
year on the key line need not be on it. Prose keys have none: a statement is
its sentence. Each alternative is one whole evidence line, unique in its
document (F475), and is listed with why it states the key's figures:

- CP-1, the 10-Q's `Cash and cash equivalents | $965 | $887`:
  - the release's `Cash and cash equivalents | $965 | $887`, its balance sheet
    row, the same two dates.
  Not alternatives: the 10-Q's `Cash and cash equivalents | $965 | $982` (its
    comparative is 30 June 2025) and the one-figure `Cash and cash equivalents
    | $965` rows of the liquidity tables (no comparative, and not a unique
    run).
- CP-2, the 10-Q's `Net cash provided by operating activities | 675 | 680`:
  - the 10-Q's `During the six months ended June 30, 2026, our operating
    activities generated operating cash inflows of $675 million, as compared to
    operating cash inflows of $680 million during the six months ended June 30,
    2025, primarily due to changes in working capital, coupled with the results
    of operations described above.`, its liquidity sentence, the six months
    against the prior six months.
- CP-2, the 10-Q's `Purchase of property and equipment | (335) | (453)`:
  - the 10-Q's `Cash used for capital expenditures totaled $335 million and
    $453 million for the six months ended June 30, 2026 and 2025, respectively,
    related to our growth, renovation, maintenance, and other capital
    projects.`, its capital-expenditure sentence: the same cash measure and six
    months.
  Not alternatives: the 10-Q's `Total | $167 | $230 | $335 | $453` under
    `Capital Expenditures, Net - By Segment` (a net segment measure, not the
    cash-flow line, though the figures agree).
- CP-2D, the release's `CEI Revolving Credit Facility capacity, net of
outstanding balance | 2,130`:
  - the 10-Q's `CEI Revolving Credit Facility capacity, net of outstanding
    balance | 2,130`, its liquidity table's row at the same date.

The other figure keys (`Total debt`, `CEI Revolving Credit Facility`, `Annual
maturities of long-term debt`) have none: no other whole line states their
figures for the same measure, period and basis (rounded prose such as `$11.8
billion` or `$1.3 billion` is not the figure).

The readiness key expects CP-0 to clear CP-1, CP-2 and CP-2D, and CP-2D to
carry `FULL` decision scope. No register key is set: the release's liquidity
total (`$2,928` million) adds the CVA facility and deducts revolver capacity
committed to letters of credit, specific reserves and regulatory requirements,
so cash plus net CEI revolver capacity (`$3,095` million) is an equally
defensible reading and no single bridge cell is unambiguous.

The 10-Q discloses the 27 May 2026 merger agreement with Fertitta Gaming
Holdco, LLC as pending; no fact about it after the 10-Q's filing is in this set.

At preparation no provider call, run, snapshot, evidence record, reviewer
verdict, or qualification claim existed; the live runs follow.

## Live results (3–5 October 2026)

| run (file) | build / tip | status | modules accepted | attempts | citations | keys met | ready / projection / register | stop cause | key usage Δ / recorded charge |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L1 (`L1-czr-liquidity.json`) | 9043ba7f / b1a7bec | COMPLETE | 4/4 | 8 | 139 (139 anch., 0 unver.) | 8/9 | met / met / — | — | +0.56 / $0.79 |
| LIQ1 (`LIQ1-czr-liquidity.json`) | 9043ba7f / ~14b9bec | COMPLETE | 4/4 | 6 | 102 (100 anch., 4 unver.) | 5/9 | met / met / — | — | +0.66 / $0.70 |

Reading the table: "build" is the first eight hex digits of the methodology build id in the run JSON; "tip" is the git tip the ledger names (`—` where the ledger names none; tips marked ~ are the base of the next fix task, so the run ran on that tree or its predecessor). "Attempts" is the run JSON's attempt list (every provider call recorded, including a dropped one). "Citations" is the run proof's total with its anchored and unverified counts (`n/r`: the run stopped before a proof was recorded). "Keys met" is the scored matrix row; a run that stopped before COMPLETE or BLOCKED is not scored (`not scored`). "Key usage Δ" is the OpenRouter key-usage change the ledger recorded for the run (`n/l`: not in the ledger); "recorded charge" is the sum of the run's attempt charges at the pinned price. The two disagree and the usage counter lags (ledger), so the key usage is the budget measure. Run files are git-ignored, under `docs/rebuild/runs/live-2026-10-03/`; the model is `openai/gpt-6-luna`, effort high, provider pinned to `openai`, in every row.

Verdict: The set is **NOT QUALIFIED**. L1 completed with 8 of 9 keys and every node accepted on its second attempt; its one miss was CP-2D's $388m letter-of-credit sub-facility sentence (no module used the figure). LIQ1, the later run with the conformed credit agreement (requests of about 1.9 MB), completed with the ready and projection keys met and 5 of 9 citation keys; its four misses are all "not cited". Single-sample quality_compare (records `q6`, `q12`): one LARGE, CP-0 committee_status Restricted against the baseline Requires More Work, recurring since L1 and defensible (the corpus has no forward cash forecast or transaction-funding inputs).

Owner-decision stops and provider limits: None.
