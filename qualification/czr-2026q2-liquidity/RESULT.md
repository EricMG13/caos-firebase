## Corpus provenance

Each document is an official SEC EDGAR filing or exhibit, fetched on
2 October 2026 and converted from HTML to plain text the same day; the first
three are byte-identical to the `czr-2026q2` set's copies. The text SHA-256 is
the digest the keys bind; the raw SHA-256 is the HTML as fetched.

The credit agreement is 935,517 bytes: over 500 KiB, so its path is pinned in
the large-file excludes, but under 1.5 MiB, so it reaches CP-0 whole rather
than as a page map. All four are inside `MAX_REQUEST_BYTES`.

## Keys

Keys authored from the documents; material figures pending owner confirmation.

- CP-1: the 10-Q's cash and cash equivalents, `$965` / `$887` million at
  30 June 2026 / 31 December 2025; and its Note 6 total debt, `11,807` face
  and `11,705` book at 30 June 2026, `11,792` book at 31 December 2025.
- CP-2: the 10-Q's six-month operating cash flow, `675` / `680` million, and
  purchase of property and equipment, `(335)` / `(453)` million.
- CP-2D: the release's CEI Revolving Credit Facility capacity net of
  outstanding balance, `2,130` million at 30 June 2026; the 10-Q's CEI
  Revolving Credit Facility row (2028 maturity, `$120` million face and book
  at 30 June 2026, `$160` million book at 31 December 2025); the 10-Q's annual
  maturities of long-term debt, `$55` / `$114` / `$767` / `$1,574` / `$3,962`
  / `$5,335` million for the rest of 2026, 2027–2030 and thereafter, totalling
  `$11,807` million; and the 10-Q's statement that the CEI Credit Agreement,
  as amended, provides for a `$2.25 billion` CEI Revolving Credit Facility
  maturing on 31 January 2028, and its next sentence, the `$388` million
  letter-of-credit sub-facility and `$40` million of reserves (each keyed as
  its whole Note 6 sentence; F475, F492).

The credit agreement carries no key. Its revolving commitment is stated as at
the 2020 signing date, and the Fourth (9 May 2024) and Fifth (25 November 2024)
Amendments are not in this set, so the current commitment is keyed to the
10-Q; the agreement is admitted for the facility's controlling terms.
Since F498 its sentences over 400 characters are cut further at their clause
boundaries (`; (b)`, `, (b)`, `; and`, `, and (c)`, `; provided`,
`, provided that`, `: (a)`); no key moves with them.

Alternative lines (D101). A figure key is also met by another whole evidence
line, cited under the same module, that states the key's lead figures -- the
current figure and the comparative the key line leads with -- for the same
measure, period and consolidated scope; a % change, a further period or a third
year on the key line need not be on it. Prose keys have none: a statement is
its sentence. Each alternative is one whole evidence line, unique in its
document (F475), and is listed with why it states the key's figures:

- CP-1, the 10-Q's `Cash and cash equivalents | $965 | $887`:
  - the release's `Cash and cash equivalents | $965 | $887`, its balance sheet
    row, the same two dates.
  Not alternatives: the 10-Q's `Cash and cash equivalents | $965 | $982` (its
    comparative is 30 June 2025) and the one-figure `Cash and cash equivalents
    | $965` rows of the liquidity tables (no comparative, and not a unique
    run).
- CP-2, the 10-Q's `Net cash provided by operating activities | 675 | 680`:
  - the 10-Q's `During the six months ended June 30, 2026, our operating
    activities generated operating cash inflows of $675 million, as compared to
    operating cash inflows of $680 million during the six months ended June 30,
    2025, primarily due to changes in working capital, coupled with the results
    of operations described above.`, its liquidity sentence, the six months
    against the prior six months.
- CP-2, the 10-Q's `Purchase of property and equipment | (335) | (453)`:
  - the 10-Q's `Cash used for capital expenditures totaled $335 million and
    $453 million for the six months ended June 30, 2026 and 2025, respectively,
    related to our growth, renovation, maintenance, and other capital
    projects.`, its capital-expenditure sentence: the same cash measure and six
    months.
  Not alternatives: the 10-Q's `Total | $167 | $230 | $335 | $453` under
    `Capital Expenditures, Net - By Segment` (a net segment measure, not the
    cash-flow line, though the figures agree).
- CP-2D, the release's `CEI Revolving Credit Facility capacity, net of
outstanding balance | 2,130`:
  - the 10-Q's `CEI Revolving Credit Facility capacity, net of outstanding
    balance | 2,130`, its liquidity table's row at the same date.

The other figure keys (`Total debt`, `CEI Revolving Credit Facility`, `Annual
maturities of long-term debt`) have none: no other whole line states their
figures for the same measure, period and basis (rounded prose such as `$11.8
billion` or `$1.3 billion` is not the figure).

The readiness key expects CP-0 to clear CP-1, CP-2 and CP-2D, and CP-2D to
carry `FULL` decision scope. No register key is set: the release's liquidity
total (`$2,928` million) adds the CVA facility and deducts revolver capacity
committed to letters of credit, specific reserves and regulatory requirements,
so cash plus net CEI revolver capacity (`$3,095` million) is an equally
defensible reading and no single bridge cell is unambiguous.

The 10-Q discloses the 27 May 2026 merger agreement with Fertitta Gaming
Holdco, LLC as pending; no fact about it after the 10-Q's filing is in this set.

No provider call, run, snapshot, evidence record, reviewer verdict, or
qualification claim exists; no run has been performed.
