# CCL FY2025 live qualification result

## Corpus and key

The case uses the public Carnival Corporation & plc FY2025 SEC filing extract
from the existing three-issuer assessment. Its source document digest is
`8fa7fceda34be50b3b9b5406e0c9269b5269870d1cd8c2bdafb682755a1c88e6`.

Expected citations were selected from the human-authored answer key at
`/Users/ericguei/Documents/Co-Pilot Agents/assessment_3issuer_20260719/corpus/ANSWER_KEY_3ISSUER.md`,
whose digest at selection was
`5be464735d2794c0ef832dd4f2d739cf270e95cf17c522473f95466b5719c376`.
The key is deliberately not an admitted document: a model must not receive the
answers it is being evaluated against.

## Run

- Qualification-set digest: `85d50a252f3158fe8a4bd8e4cd0747409f1b559460c16bdc1761b8745d381eb5`
- Route: `LITE_CREDIT_22 / LITE_EARNINGS_UPDATE` (`CP-0`, `CP-L10`, `CP-5`)
- Provider/model: `openrouter / deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro-0813`
- Price configuration: `$0.96` input and `$2.88` output per million tokens, dated 2026-09-15
- Run ceiling: `$22.00`
- Local development run: `01b79673-cbe6-4e5c-8751-642ea69335cd`

## Result

The run is **not qualified**. CP-0 made three billed attempts and none produced
an accepted canonical handoff:

| Attempt | Refusal |
|---|---|
| 1 | `HANDOFF_INCOMPLETE` |
| 2 | `HANDOFF_MALFORMED` |
| 3 | `HANDOFF_MALFORMED` |

Recorded charge: `$0.465377216`. No artifact or matrix was produced, so no
evidence row or verdict was recorded. A qualification verdict must never turn
this failed host validation into `QUALIFIED`.

## Canonical compatibility diagnosis

All three stored provider bodies used the required closed JSON transport. The
canonical Markdown inside them failed for three concrete instruction-following
reasons: a non-canonical snake-case T8 header, an omitted T8 register, and
citations whose `matched_text` was not repeated verbatim in the Markdown body.
The request had placed its response contract before the large evidence section
and ended on evidence, leaving those constraints far from the generation point.

The host now closes the tagged evidence section and repeats the closed transport,
six-heading order, register, CP-0 T8-header, and citation checks at the end of the
prompt. Strict handoff and citation validation is unchanged.

A fresh validation run, `90dc1bb3-6301-4af7-955e-717824672a90`, reached the
provider twice but stopped both times with `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`. Neither
attempt returned a body, generation ID, or charge, so live confirmation remains
pending and the model remains **not qualified**.

## Direct Terra comparison

An isolated `gpt-5.6-terra` probe answered the same generated CP-0 prompt without
OpenRouter. Its first response passed the closed JSON and base Markdown checks
but added `owned_object` and `canonical_filename` to front matter; the authority
mentions payload metadata that the canonical Markdown validator correctly
forbids there. The prompt now derives and names the exact model-authored
front-matter fields from that validator.

With that correction, Terra passed structure, identity, completeness, and T8,
then failed citation anchoring because `FORM 10-K` appears more than once on the
cited page. After the prompt explicitly required a unique page quote, a fresh
Terra response repeated the same ambiguous citation. This establishes that the
remaining incompatibility is neither OpenRouter-only nor DeepSeek-only: strict
citation selection was unreliable across models.

The host now pre-validates delivered lines with the same anchoring function used
at acceptance and marks the three longest valid candidates on each source page.
The final prompt contained 87 marked candidates across 1,726 delivered blocks,
without duplicating any source text. A fresh Terra response to that exact prompt
passed structure, identity, completeness, T8, and citation anchoring; its one
citation was one of the marked candidates. The handoff's `qa_status: Blocked`
was therefore accepted as a valid domain verdict for the incomplete
single-document source set, then terminated as `HANDOFF_BLOCKED` by design.

This resolves the canonical-handoff incompatibility in the direct cross-model
probe. It is not DeepSeek qualification evidence: OpenRouter returned no body on
the subsequent live attempts, so `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro-0813` remains **not
qualified** until a fresh provider run completes the qualification matrix.
