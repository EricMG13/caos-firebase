## Corpus provenance

Each document is an official SEC EDGAR filing or exhibit, fetched on

All three are under 1.5 MiB, so each reaches CP-0 whole rather than as a page
map, and all are inside `MAX_REQUEST_BYTES`.

## Keys

Keys authored from the documents; material figures pending owner confirmation.

- CP-0: the release's Q2 2026 consolidated net revenues, `$2,993` million
  against `$2,907` million (+3.0%).
- CP-L10: the release's consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure),
  `$920` / `$955` million for the quarter and `$1,807` / `$1,839` million for
  the six months; total outstanding indebtedness `$11,807` million at
  30 June 2026 against `$11,905` million at 31 December 2025; and the 10-K's
  net revenues `11,486` / `11,245` / `11,528` million for 2025 / 2024 / 2023.
- CP-5: the 10-Q's Note 6 total debt, `11,807` face and `11,705` book at
  30 June 2026, `11,792` book at 31 December 2025.

Alternative lines (D101). A figure key is also met by another whole evidence
line, cited under the same module, that states the key's lead figures -- the
current figure and the comparative the key line leads with -- for the same
measure, period and consolidated scope; a % change, a further period or a third
year on the key line need not be on it. Prose keys have none: a statement is
its sentence. Each alternative is one whole evidence line, unique in its
document (F475), and is listed with why it states the key's figures:

- CP-0, the release's `Caesars | $2,993 | $2,907 | 3.0%`:
  - the 10-Q's `Net revenues | 2,993 | 2,907 | 5,863 | 5,701`, its consolidated
    statement of operations row;
  - the 10-Q's `Total | $2,993 | $2,907 | $5,863 | $5,701`, the total of its
    segment table's net revenues, the consolidated figure;
  - the 10-Q's `Net revenues | $2,993 | $2,907 | $86 | 3.0% | $5,863 | $5,701 |
    $162 | 2.8%`, its MD&A net revenues row;
  - the release's `Net revenues | 2,993 | 2,907 | 5,863 | 5,701`, its
    consolidated statement of operations row.
  Not alternatives: the release's `GAAP net revenues of $3.0 billion versus
    $2.9 billion` (rounded, not the figures) and its six-month `Caesars |
    $5,863 | $5,701 | 2.8%` (another period).
- CP-L10, the release's `Adjusted EBITDA | $920 | $955 | $1,807 | $1,839`:
  - the 10-Q's `Total | $920 | $955 | $1,807 | $1,839`, the total of its
    segment table's Adjusted EBITDA, the consolidated figure;
  - the 10-Q's `Total Adjusted EBITDA | $920 | $955 | $1,807 | $1,839`, its
    MD&A reconciliation's total;
  - the release's `Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $920 million versus $955
    million for the comparable prior-year period.`, its highlight sentence:
    consolidated, the quarter against the prior-year quarter;
  - the release's `Caesars | $920 | $955 | (3.7)%`, the consolidated row of its
    quarterly Adjusted EBITDA table;
  - the 10-Q's `Adjusted EBITDA | $920 | $955 | $1,807 | $1,839`, the
    consolidated line its segment note reconciles net loss to. Its words also
    run inside the MD&A's `Total Adjusted EBITDA` row, which no longer bars a
    whole line (K2, F502).
  Not alternatives: the release's six-month `Caesars | $1,807 | $1,839 |
    (1.7)%` (the six months alone).
- CP-L10, the 10-K's `Net revenues | 11,486 | 11,245 | 11,528`:
  - the 10-K's `Total | $11,486 | $11,245 | $11,528`, the total of its segment
    table's net revenues, the consolidated figure;
  - the 10-K's `Net Revenues | $11,486 | $11,245 | $11,528 | $241 | 2.1% |
    $(283) | (2.5)%`, its MD&A net revenues row.

The other figure keys (`Total outstanding indebtedness`, `Total debt`) have
none: no other whole line states their figures for the same measure, period and
basis (rounded prose such as `$11.8 billion` or `$1.3 billion` is not the
figure).

The readiness key expects CP-0 to clear CP-L10 and CP-5, and CP-L10 to carry
`SCREENING_ONLY` decision scope. No register key is set: a Q2 update has more
than one defensible comparator (quarter, six months, or the fiscal year), so no
single register cell is unambiguous.

The 10-Q discloses the 27 May 2026 merger agreement with Fertitta Gaming
Holdco, LLC as pending; no fact about it after the 10-Q's filing is in this set.

No provider call, run, snapshot, evidence record, reviewer verdict, or
qualification claim exists; no run has been performed.
