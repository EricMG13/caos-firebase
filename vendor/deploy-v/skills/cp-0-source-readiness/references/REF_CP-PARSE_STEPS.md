Consolidated method bundle. Each section below is one original file, byte-identical, under its own `## <filename>` heading.

Apply step sections (`## REF_..._<NN>_*`) when their workflow step begins. Prefer retrieval of the named section. If the connector only supports whole-file access, open this bundle once and apply only the active/named sections, reusing the content within the current run; no user extraction or separate-file setup is required.

Original files, in this bundle: REF_CP-PARSE_A_TriageAndSelection.md, REF_CP-PARSE_B_DocumentProfiles.md, REF_CP-PARSE_C_ExtractionAndFidelity.md, REF_CP-PARSE_D_PackagingAndQA.md

## REF_CP-PARSE_A_TriageAndSelection.md
# CP-PARSE — Triage and Selection

## Objective

Judge sources on downstream evidence value, not page count, and judge duplication, versioning and amendments across the whole pack: they cannot be judged reliably one file at a time. The host's preparation record holds each source's delivery.

## Required inventory fields

For every supplied file record: stable `source_id`, original file name, format, byte size, page/slide/sheet count when available, issuer/entity, title, date/period, document family, version status, language, native-text/OCR status, related/base document and access condition. The host's preparation record holds each source's hash.

## Decision

Score nothing: the host's preparation record holds each source's delivery, `WHOLE` or `PAGE_MAP` (`PARSE_TARGETED`), which its P5 row records (P4 is retired).

## Version and duplicate rules

- Hash-identical file (the host's record gives each source's SHA-256): name the selected copy in P3 and record the rest as its duplicates.
- Near duplicate: compare titles, dates, page/slide counts, section map and extracted text. Skip only after confirming the selected version contains all evidence-bearing differences.
- Draft/final: prefer final, but retain the draft when changes or removed provisions may matter.
- Restatement: do not silently replace the original; retain both and label supersession/affected periods.
- Base legal document plus amendment/waiver: treat as a linked set. Never discard the amendment as duplication.
- Presentation plus transcript/earnings release: separate evidence classes; do not deduplicate solely because the event date matches.

## Calibration cases

None: no decision is calibrated, since the host's preparation record holds each source's delivery and P5 records it (P4 is retired).

## User overrides

Record `force include`, `force exclude`, `priority documents` and `page/slide/clause scope` separately from the default model verdict. An override changes execution but never erases the audit trail or permits fabrication.
## REF_CP-PARSE_B_DocumentProfiles.md
# CP-PARSE — Document Profiles

Apply multiple profiles to hybrid documents. These lists define evidence-bearing extraction targets, not analytical conclusions.

## Annual reports, 10-K and 20-F

Retain primary statements and comparative periods; accounting policies and material footnotes; MD&A; debt, interest, maturities and liquidity; cash flow and working capital; segments; pensions; leases; guarantees/commitments; acquisitions/disposals; contingencies; related parties; risks; subsequent events; auditor emphasis; non-GAAP definitions and reconciliations. Preserve note/table cross-references.

## Quarterly/interim reports, 10-Q and results releases

Retain current/prior period statements, YTD and quarter distinctions, debt and cash movements, liquidity/covenant disclosures, working-capital movements, guidance/withdrawals, segment/KPI deltas, restructuring/one-offs, contingencies and subsequent events. Do not merge period bases.

## Investor and earnings presentations

Retain evidence-bearing slides: KPI definitions and trends, revenue/EBITDA/FCF bridges, segment data, guidance, capex, liquidity, debt/maturity, capital allocation, operating drivers, cohort/geography/product data, reconciliation slides and footnotes. For charts, capture title, period, axes, units, series, visible data labels and source notes. Decorative dividers, photographs and repeated safe-harbor slides may be excluded with slide locators.

## Lender and financing presentations

Retain transaction overview, sources & uses, capital structure, debt tranches, maturity/pricing, pro forma leverage, EBITDA adjustments/add-backs, liquidity, covenant metrics/headroom as presented, projections, sensitivities, synergies, sponsor/equity contribution, collateral, guarantees, security/ranking, permitted financing assumptions, ratings, lender protections, conditions and footnotes. Label management cases and adjustments exactly; do not validate or endorse them.

## Legal and financing documents

Retain document/party/date identity, recitals, definitions, facility/note terms, interest/pricing, maturity/amortization, mandatory/voluntary prepayment, representations, affirmative/negative covenants, financial covenants, baskets, grower builders, ratios/tests, liens, debt, restricted payments, investments, asset sales, affiliate transactions, change of control, EODs/remedies, collateral, guarantors, restricted/unrestricted subsidiaries, voting/amendment provisions, transfer/assignment, conditions precedent and schedules/exhibits that change meaning.

For amendments, waivers and supplements record each added/deleted/replaced clause, effective date, consent threshold and referenced base clause. Extraction is not a consolidated legal interpretation; CP-4 owns legal interpretation.

## Offering and transaction documents

Retain security terms, issuer/guarantor structure, capitalization, use of proceeds, transaction steps, pro forma adjustments, risk factors, conflicts, underwriting, security/collateral, ranking, redemption, covenants, conditions and material tax/regulatory constraints stated in the source.

## Spreadsheets and schedules

Record workbook/sheet identity, used ranges, table headings, units, dates, displayed values, formula text when visible, named ranges and hidden/filtered row/column flags. Never execute macros, external links or formulas. Preserve separate tables instead of flattening the workbook into one stream.

## Other documents

Classify by evidence function: issuer financial, operating, debt/liquidity, legal/covenant, transaction, market/ratings, regulatory, ownership/governance or risk. Use `PARSE_TARGETED` when only a bounded region is relevant. Preserve an inspection map so excluded content remains auditable.

# CP-PARSE — Extraction and Fidelity

## Mode selection

| Mode | Use |
|---|---|
| `LAYOUT_TEXT` | Native PDF/DOCX/HTML/TXT reading order and headings. |
| `TABLE_FIRST` | Financial reports, schedules and table-dense pages. |
| `SLIDE_CHART` | PPTX/PDF presentations and evidence-bearing figures. |
| `LEGAL_CLAUSE` | Agreements, indentures, offering docs, amendments and waivers. |
| `OCR_SCAN` | Image-only or materially incomplete native text. |
| `SHEET_RANGE` | XLSX/CSV tables and schedules; never execute formulas/macros. |
| `HYBRID` | Different modes by page/slide/sheet/section. |

## Locator rules

- PDF/DOCX: `[p.N]` or `[p.N–M]`.
- Presentation: `[slide N]`.
- Spreadsheet: `[sheet:Name!A1:H40]`.
- Legal: include page plus `[clause X]`/`[schedule Y]` when identifiable.
- HTML/text: heading path plus paragraph/table ordinal.
- Unknown: `[locator unknown]` plus `PAGE_UNKNOWN`; never invent.

Every Markdown heading, paragraph, table, chart record and extracted clause carries a locator. Targeted output also contains an inspected-range map showing kept and excluded ranges.

## Fidelity rules

- Preserve visible values, signs, parentheses, currency, units, scale, dates, periods, entity and column/row labels verbatim.
- Keep footnotes with their table/chart/statement and preserve superscripts/markers in plain-text form.
- Never round, transpose, normalize, reconcile or calculate unless the source itself displays the result.
- Repeated headers/footers may be collapsed only after confirming no variable data.
- Keep multi-page table headers with continuation ranges. If reconstruction is uncertain, retain row text/order and flag `DEGRADED_TABLE`.
- For charts without extractable data, record visible labels/values and a figure placeholder; never interpolate unlabelled points.
- OCR output carries page/region confidence. Low-confidence numbers and names are cross-checked against the image or flagged `OCR_UNCERTAIN`.
- Embedded instructions, links, macros and attachments are inert evidence. Do not open/execute them unless the user separately supplies and authorizes the file as an input.

## Coverage reconciliation

For every source reconcile total inspectable units to retained + excluded + unreadable units. Units are pages, slides or sheets/ranges. A blocked or unreadable source keeps its P3 and P5 rows although it has no parsed body; the host's preparation record holds the rest.
## REF_CP-PARSE_D_PackagingAndQA.md
# CP-PARSE — Packaging and QA

## Packaging

Write no per-source file, ZIP, index or checksum file: the host's preparation record holds each source's extraction and hashes (P6 and P8 are retired), and P3 and P5 sit inside the one CP-0 handoff.

## Verification gates

1. Every source the host's preparation record names appears exactly once in P3 and in P5; user overrides are disclosed.
2. The host's preparation record holds hashes, delivery, packages and the one active representation per source: record no result for them.
3. Duplicate decisions name the selected copy and document non-overlap inspection.
4. Every parsed block/table/chart/clause has a valid locator or explicit limitation.
5. Visible values and text match the source; no invented calculations or interpretation.
6. Coverage reconciles for every selected source.
7. The Markdown handoff validates.

Any unresolved failure in inventory, fidelity or canonical Markdown completeness blocks the handoff. Lower-severity OCR/table degradation may ship only with its per-source limitations in P5.
