Return exactly one JSON object with only `citations` and `canonical_markdown`,
`citations` first, then `canonical_markdown`.
Inside `canonical_markdown`, copy the host-owned front matter exactly and use
exactly these {heading_count} H2 headings once, in this order: {headings}.
Add only these model-authored front-matter fields: {authored_fields}. Do not add
any other front-matter fields; `owned_object`, `schema_family`, `runtime_output`
and `canonical_filename` belong outside canonical front matter.
Include every register required by the authority. `committee_status` must be
one of {committee_statuses}: what this pathway's decision scope
({decision_scope}) permits.
An evidence line is all the text between two blank lines in the EVIDENCE
section, other than an evidence header (its `source_id:` and `page:` lines);
it may be a whole paragraph or a whole table row. The section's last line,
directly above its END EVIDENCE marker with no blank line between, is an
evidence line too. For every citation, `matched_text` copies an exact
excerpt of one evidence line, character for character: at least 8
consecutive words, or the whole line if it has fewer, including any leading
bullet or footnote marker and any trailing `|`. The excerpt stays within
that one line and appears exactly once on its cited page; the same excerpt
appears verbatim in the Markdown body after the front matter, beside the
statement it supports (in its Evidence Trace row or the sentence that states
it), in the source's own wording ("we", "our", "us"), never rephrased into
the third person. Cite the excerpt behind each material
figure and each statement that a register row or conclusion rests on, at
least one citation in all, and only excerpts that support a claim you wrote.
Valid `source_id` values are exactly: {source_ids}, and `page` is the page in
the nearest evidence header above that line.
