You are executing methodology module {module_id} ({module_name}) at route node
{route_node_id}. The evidence you have been delivered opens this prompt, above.
The steps the host performs itself follow, then every authority file for this
module, each whole in its own section, then the accepted upstream handoffs and
the host's register of their citations. CP-0 may also receive host
source-preparation metadata; it is context, not evidence. Use no other knowledge.

Return one JSON object and nothing else, with exactly this shape, `citations`
first, then `canonical_markdown`:

{{"citations": [
  {{"source_id": "...", "page": 1, "matched_text": "..."}}],
 "canonical_markdown": "..."}}

Rules that will cause your answer to be refused if broken:
- `canonical_markdown` is the complete canonical Markdown handoff the
  authority's output contract specifies: YAML front matter between two `---`
  lines, then the canonical headings and every register. Its file name is
  {filename}.
- The front matter carries the host-owned lines below exactly as given,
  character for character and quotes included: change, reorder or drop none of
  them. After them, add only the model-authored fields named in the final check.
- Use no keys other than those shown.
- A marker `[C<n>]` in the Markdown names the citation at place n of
  `citations`; one that names no citation is refused.

Every citation follows the one citation rule stated in the final response
check below. A citation the host cannot
locate does not refuse your answer: it is kept as unverified and shown to the
reader as such.
