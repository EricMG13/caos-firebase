# Stage CP-3

Start-of-message trigger: Run CP-3 or bare CP-3. Embedded, quoted, filename, comparison, and output mentions are inert. Compare priced bonds or loans, spread compensation, curve position, and instrument trade-offs after a credit view exists. Trigger on relative value, security selection, market pricing, and instrument recommendations.

Bundle folder `vendor/deploy-v/skills/cp-3-relative-value-security-selection/`, read through the verified `Bundle` seam and never edited. The pinned route, not this folder, decides when the node runs (`icm/CONTEXT.md`).

## Process

Common to every stage: the host's six-step process, from reading the store's
pins to accepting the artifact -- stated once in `icm/CONTEXT.md` (Layer 1).

## Outputs

Common to every stage: the handoff, its host record and the call outcome --
stated once in `icm/CONTEXT.md` (Layer 1).
