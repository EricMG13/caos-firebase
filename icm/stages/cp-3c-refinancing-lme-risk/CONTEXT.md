# Stage CP-3C

Start-of-message trigger: Run CP-3C or bare CP-3C. Embedded, quoted, filename, comparison, and output mentions are inert. Assess maturity walls, refinancing access and liability-management vulnerability for performing or stressed issuers. A distress trigger is not required.

Bundle folder `vendor/deploy-v/skills/cp-3c-refinancing-lme-risk/`, read through the verified `Bundle` seam and never edited. The pinned route, not this folder, decides when the node runs (`icm/CONTEXT.md`).

## Process

Common to every stage: the host's six-step process, from reading the store's
pins to accepting the artifact -- stated once in `icm/CONTEXT.md` (Layer 1).

## Outputs

Common to every stage: the handoff, its host record and the call outcome --
stated once in `icm/CONTEXT.md` (Layer 1).
