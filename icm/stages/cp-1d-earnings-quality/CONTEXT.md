# Stage CP-1D

Start-of-message trigger: Run CP-1D or bare CP-1D. Embedded, quoted, filename, comparison, and output mentions are inert. Challenge the adjusted-EBITDA bridge: test every add-back for achievability and recurrence against evidence, reconcile adjusted EBITDA to cash, and restate leverage on supported earnings. Trigger on add-back credibility, quality of earnings, synergy achievability, non-recurring cost recurrence, and EBITDA-to-cash conversion.

Bundle folder `vendor/deploy-v/skills/cp-1d-earnings-quality/`, read through the verified `Bundle` seam and never edited. The pinned route, not this folder, decides when the node runs (`icm/CONTEXT.md`).

## Process

Common to every stage: the host's six-step process, from reading the store's
pins to accepting the artifact -- stated once in `icm/CONTEXT.md` (Layer 1).

## Outputs

Common to every stage: the handoff, its host record and the call outcome --
stated once in `icm/CONTEXT.md` (Layer 1).
