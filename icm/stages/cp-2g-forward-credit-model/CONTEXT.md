# Stage CP-2G

Start-of-message trigger: Run CP-2G or bare CP-2G. Embedded, quoted, filename, comparison, and output mentions are inert. Build auditable base, upside, and downside forecasts for earnings, free cash flow, debt, liquidity, leverage, coverage, and deleveraging. Trigger on multi-period forecast cases, credit-model assumptions, and financial breakpoints.

Bundle folder `vendor/deploy-v/skills/cp-2g-forward-credit-model/`, read through the verified `Bundle` seam and never edited. The pinned route, not this folder, decides when the node runs (`icm/CONTEXT.md`).

| prompt | icm/shared/prompt/current_command.md | whole | prompt block, when the run's pinned command names this module (D109) |

| prompt | icm/shared/prompt/validator_feedback.md | whole | prompt block, on a node's guided retry after a refused answer (D30, D82), when that answer is not carried (D104) |
| prompt | icm/shared/prompt/validator_repair.md | whole | prompt block, on a node's guided retry that carries its refused answer to be corrected (D104) |

## Process

Common to every stage: the host's six-step process, from reading the store's
pins to accepting the artifact -- stated once in `icm/CONTEXT.md` (Layer 1).

## Outputs

Common to every stage: the handoff, its host record and the call outcome --
stated once in `icm/CONTEXT.md` (Layer 1).
