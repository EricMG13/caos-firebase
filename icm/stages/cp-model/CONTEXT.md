# Stage CP-MODEL

Start-of-message trigger: Run CP-MODEL or bare CP-MODEL. Embedded, quoted, filename, comparison, and output mentions are inert. Build the canonical CP-MODEL Credit Snapshot plus historical/forecast Excel workbook from validated CP-1, CP-1A, CP-1B, CP-2, CP-2A and optional CP-2G handoffs. Use only when the user explicitly asks to create or populate the CP-MODEL workbook.

Bundle folder `vendor/deploy-v/skills/cp-model/`, read through the verified `Bundle` seam and never edited. The pinned route, not this folder, decides when the node runs (`icm/CONTEXT.md`).

## Process

Common to every stage: the host's six-step process, from reading the store's
pins to accepting the artifact -- stated once in `icm/CONTEXT.md` (Layer 1).

## Outputs

Common to every stage: the handoff, its host record and the call outcome --
stated once in `icm/CONTEXT.md` (Layer 1).
