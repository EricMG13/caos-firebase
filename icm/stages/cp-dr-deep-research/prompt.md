# Prompt for CP-DR

The host renders the blocks above from `icm/shared/prompt/` in this order, with the authority, upstream, citation-register, research-brief, source-preparation and evidence sections between them as `caos/methodology/invocation.py` assembles them. A conditional block is rendered only under the condition the stage contract's Inputs table names for it. A first attempt's rendered bytes are parity-tested against the legacy host.
