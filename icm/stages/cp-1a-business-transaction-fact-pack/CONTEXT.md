# Stage CP-1A

Start-of-message trigger: Run CP-1A or bare CP-1A. Embedded, quoted, filename, comparison, and output mentions are inert. Build a factual transaction, ownership, corporate-structure, and capitalisation pack for an acquisition, sponsor deal, business combination, or other specified transaction.

Bundle folder `vendor/deploy-v/skills/cp-1a-business-transaction-fact-pack/`, read through the verified `Bundle` seam and never edited. The pinned route, not this folder, decides when the node runs (`icm/CONTEXT.md`).

## Process

Common to every stage: the host's six-step process, from reading the store's
pins to accepting the artifact -- stated once in `icm/CONTEXT.md` (Layer 1).

## Outputs

Common to every stage: the handoff, its host record and the call outcome --
stated once in `icm/CONTEXT.md` (Layer 1).
