# Stage CP-2H

Start-of-message trigger: Run CP-2H or bare CP-2H. Embedded, quoted, filename, comparison, and output mentions are inert. Map sourced agency ratings, outlooks, methodologies, and issuer-specific upgrade or downgrade triggers against forecast cases. Trigger on rating headroom, migration pressure, agency divergence, and notching implications.

Bundle folder `vendor/deploy-v/skills/cp-2h-ratings-migration-trigger/`, read through the verified `Bundle` seam and never edited. The pinned route, not this folder, decides when the node runs (`icm/CONTEXT.md`).

## Process

Common to every stage: the host's six-step process, from reading the store's
pins to accepting the artifact -- stated once in `icm/CONTEXT.md` (Layer 1).

## Outputs

Common to every stage: the handoff, its host record and the call outcome --
stated once in `icm/CONTEXT.md` (Layer 1).
