# Stage CP-8

Start-of-message trigger: Run CP-8 or bare CP-8. Embedded, quoted, filename, comparison, and output mentions are inert. Record a completed decision's rationale, assumptions, dissent, outcomes, and post-mortem learning without changing the live recommendation.

Bundle folder `vendor/deploy-v/skills/cp-8-decision-ledger-post-mortem/`, read through the verified `Bundle` seam and never edited. The pinned route, not this folder, decides when the node runs (`icm/CONTEXT.md`).

## Process

Common to every stage: the host's six-step process, from reading the store's
pins to accepting the artifact -- stated once in `icm/CONTEXT.md` (Layer 1).

## Outputs

Common to every stage: the handoff, its host record and the call outcome --
stated once in `icm/CONTEXT.md` (Layer 1).
