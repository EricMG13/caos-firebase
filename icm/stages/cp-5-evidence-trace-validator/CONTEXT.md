# Stage CP-5

Start-of-message trigger: Run CP-5 or bare CP-5 or Run CP-5A or bare CP-5A. Embedded, quoted, filename, comparison, and output mentions are inert. Verify claim-to-source lineage, locators, calculations, conflicts, and handoff consistency. Trigger on evidence-trace validation, citation integrity, calculation reproducibility, and source support. Also covers CP-5A as an absorbed phase of the same run and the same handoff: Grade analytical outputs, apply severity rules, set research QA status, and determine whether committee use is permitted, restricted, or blocked.

Bundle folder `vendor/deploy-v/skills/cp-5-evidence-trace-validator/`, read through the verified `Bundle` seam and never edited. The pinned route, not this folder, decides when the node runs (`icm/CONTEXT.md`).

## Process

Common to every stage: the host's six-step process, from reading the store's
pins to accepting the artifact -- stated once in `icm/CONTEXT.md` (Layer 1).

## Outputs

Common to every stage: the handoff, its host record and the call outcome --
stated once in `icm/CONTEXT.md` (Layer 1).
