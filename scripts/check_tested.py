"""Refuse a public function or class that no test names.

Logic and correctness errors are ~75% more frequent in agent-written code,
and the control is a test that was watched to fail. This gate cannot see
whether a test was written first; it can and does refuse the case where no
test mentions the symbol at all.

Scope is module-level definitions. Methods are covered through the class that
holds them -- see the known-gaps ledger in CLAUDE.md.

The axis is a *reference*, not a mention. This gate used to search every byte
of the suite for the symbol's name, and on 17 September 2026 that passed
`canonical._within_reservation` -- the guard that stops a rebuilt prompt going
out under too small a reservation, which is invariant 8's whole claim on that
path -- with no test driving it, because the name appeared in a **comment** in
`caos/graph/runtime.py`. A sentence about the code satisfied the check for
the code. Names are resolved through the AST now, so a comment, a docstring and
a prose string satisfy nothing.

What is still admitted from a string is a dotted identifier path, because
`monkeypatch.setattr("caos.store.runs.append", ...)` is a real reference and
Python gives it no other spelling. A path is `a.b.c` and prose is not, so the
axis holds.

And a reference names its module (DQ-11, FP-18). One set of bare names served
the whole suite, so `def verify` anywhere was cleared by the suite's references
to `caos.deliverable.verify_package.verify`. A reference is resolved through
the importing file's own bindings to `module.name` -- `from m import f`, an
`import m as x` followed by `x.f`, `setattr(x, "f", ...)`, a dotted string --
and through the re-exports of the module it was imported from, and a definition
is cleared only by a reference to it in its own module. The definitions are
every module-level public function, class and lambda, those under a module-level
`if` or `try` included, and a route is a handler registered on an `APIRouter`
or `FastAPI` object the module made -- not any decorator spelled `.get(...)`.
