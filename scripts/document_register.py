"""Refuse a qualification set that names a document the document register does not.

The programme's remaining work is deploying pathways, and every pathway needs
documents its modules demand. Which documents those are is a reading of the
vendored SKILL.md files, and a reading decays: a set gets a new document, the
register is not updated, and nobody can say afterwards where the bytes came
from or whether the owner still has to source something.

So the register is half hand-authored and half emitted. `qualification/
documents.json` carries what only a person can say -- the demand, the public
location, the status. This script carries what only the tree can say -- which
documents the sets actually name, and each one's digest and size from the bytes
on disk -- and refuses when the two disagree.

It fetches nothing and admits nothing. The owner sources every document; the
coordinator admits it.
