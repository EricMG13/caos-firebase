"""Refuse a gate configuration that has been loosened (spec G16, D15).

Every threshold the gate table states is read back from the files that hold
it, as the tool will apply it: a key that could narrow what a tool reads or
silence what it reports is refused, not only a threshold that moved (MAX-13).
The number of suppressions in tracked Python must equal the committed
baseline: a new one fails, and so does one removed while the baseline keeps
its room (DF-11). `--baseline` rewrites the baseline from the current tree,
and `--against <revision>` refuses a count that rose above that revision's
own tree, both measured fresh under this commit's rules (FP-11) and under
that revision's own checker (W5).

The secret-scan workflows (`gitleaks.yml`, `secrets-weekly.yml`) are pinned
whole by the sha256 of their parsed YAML (C1). After a deliberate change --
a gitleaks or action pin upgrade -- regenerate the pins with

    uv run python scripts/check_gate_config.py | grep 'is not as pinned'

which prints each changed file's current sha256 (`actions_file_pin`), review
the workflow diff, and set `GITLEAKS_CI_SHA256` or `SECRETS_WEEKLY_SHA256`
below to the digest shown.
