"""The file set a gate scans: what we wrote, so a gate judges what we can change.

Shared by the vocabulary and untested-definition gates. `git ls-files` rather
than a tree walk, because .gitignore already answers "is this ours" and a walk
would re-answer it differently. Vendored trees are excluded: the methodology
bundle is authority we never edit (CLAUDE.md invariant 4), so a vocabulary or coverage
finding inside it names something no PR is allowed to fix.

The home for every call in this repository that shells to git: a resolved
executable, no shell, and pathspecs and revisions that are constants or
caller-supplied strings, never interpolated into a command line.
