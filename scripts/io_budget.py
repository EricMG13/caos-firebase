"""Refuse a server that declares no I/O budget for its request paths.

Excessive I/O is the largest single multiple measured for this N+1 shape
(~8x), and the predecessor had exactly that defect: evidence blocks lived in
one JSON column, so `read_evidence` parsed every block of a source on every
call.

Every module under `caos/api/` declares `IO_BUDGET`, the number of store
round-trips a request through it may cost. A module that makes no round trip
declares `0`: zero is a cost, and stating it is cheaper than proving an
exemption.

Every module rather than every module a heuristic recognises as serving a path.
"It declares no route decorator" and "it never names the store" are both things
a module can stop being true of without anyone noticing, so a gate resting on
either is one the next request path can be written around -- which is exactly
what the weaker floor this replaces allowed. The floor is the route directory,
not the whole server: a store module has no request path, and `caos/api/` is
the one directory where every file is on one -- its `__init__.py` files
included, since a package can serve a route as well as any module can.

And the value, not only the spelling. A declaration is read twice: as the
source states it, which refuses `float("inf")` and `None` where they are
written, and as Python evaluates it, which is the only reading that sees
`math.inf`, `~0` or `10 ** 100` for what they are. The evaluated value must be
a whole number of round trips between 0 and `CEILING`, or a map of them.

A shape in range is not a cost anyone measured (F123): a declared 37 once
cost 149 round trips on the route that actually reaches it. `--record`
snapshots `MEASURED_MODULES`' current, test-verified `IO_BUDGET` and
`BLOB_BUDGET` (the blob dimension, N35 -- declared only where a route
downloads verified bytes) to `tests/io_measurements.json`; `--assert`
refuses a declaration that has fallen under what was last recorded there,
and a measured module, or a dimension it declares, that the record does
not carry at all (W6).
