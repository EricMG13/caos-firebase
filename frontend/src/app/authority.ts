// Book was its unavailable shell and were kept rather than deleted, because
// `test_book_binds_one_snapshot_per_compared_case` is pinned by name in
// `tests/test_phase_exits.py` and deleting them would have meant editing a
// gate to make a gate pass. Task 12.3 gave them their caller back: the Book
// section binds each credit through `@/app/ledger`, and only the explicit lens
// switch moves a binding.
