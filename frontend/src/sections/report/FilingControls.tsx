// The filing chain's four governed writes (Task 12.1's routes, placed here by
// Task 12.2): save a revision from the run's accepted artifacts and this
// draft, sign the exact bytes on screen, freeze them, file them.
//
// Sign and freeze sit on Report rather than Committee because `read_committee`
// refuses a revision that is not frozen, so the Committee section can never
// offer the two acts that would make it one. Save is there for the same
// reason -- and it is the one act a run with no revision is offered, so the
// Report served without `?revision` is where a case's first revision is made
// and where that address is first set. Filing acts on an already-frozen revision, which is exactly what
// Committee serves; it sits here to keep the chain on one surface, not
// because Committee could not offer it.
//
// Every control renders from the document's own `chrome.actions` -- present
// and refused, never hidden -- and grants nothing: the three-actor rule, the
// digest each act binds and the head a draft was composed against are all
// checked at commit, under the case lock. A signer whose browser still offers
// "Freeze" is refused there, and that refusal is what this surface shows.
