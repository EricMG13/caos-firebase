"""The one process a Databricks App runs: the API, with the worker beside it.

`app.yaml` runs `python -m caos.serve`. The bind host comes from the
environment (`CAOS_BIND_HOST`; the App sets the platform's all-interfaces
address, local development keeps loopback) and the port from
`DATABRICKS_APP_PORT`, which the platform injects. The worker thread starts
only when `CAOS_WORKER_IN_PROCESS=1` (D11), and a refused configuration is
printed as its typed code while the API still serves.

On the platform's SIGTERM uvicorn stops taking connections, gives the open
ones `GRACEFUL_SECONDS` to end, then runs the app's shutdown, which drains
the worker (DP-4): `stopping` is set and the thread is given
`LIMIT_JOIN_SECONDS` to finish the node in flight, all inside the grace the
platform allows before it kills the process. A call still on the wire past
that is abandoned with its reservation held and the run is reclaimed after
its lease. uvicorn re-raises the signal after shutdown, so nothing after
`uvicorn.run` can be relied on to run; the drain lives in the lifespan.
