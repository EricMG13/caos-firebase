-- D118 fix round 1: a failure the provider declared after content began is
-- its own drop kind, `declared_after_content`. It shares the node's one
-- automatic re-attempt with `declared`, but the call may have been billed
-- for what it streamed, so its row may name the stream's generation id: the
-- handle its unknown bill is reconciled by. Never a charge or a stored body.
-- Every other drop kind still names nothing. The rows stay immutable
-- (0007's triggers); both checks are validated against every existing row.
