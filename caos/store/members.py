"""Case standing: who may do what, on which case.

Case standing and global role are separate, and only standing is rechecked at
commit time: `caos/store/audit.py`'s `governed_write` calls
`_require_standing` for the same reason a check anywhere else is a check at
request time wearing a different name. The global role is not re-read there;
it is whatever `caos/api/identity.py` cached for up to `CACHE_SECONDS`
(300 s) when the request began (D10/F13, accepted).

Standing is ordered. An ADMIN can do what a WRITER can, which is why `requires`
is a floor rather than an equality -- an authority model that demanded the exact
standing would refuse an administrator doing an ordinary thing.
