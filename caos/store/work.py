"""The run work queue: one claim per run, fenced by a token (brief D1-D4).

A run with no `run_work` row is driven by a direct caller (the harness, tests).
Once enqueued, only the holder of its current lease may write to it. The token,
not the clock, is the fence: every claim advances it, so a holder whose lease
expired and was reclaimed carries a token no row still matches.

Lock order is case, then run (`lock_run`), then `run_work`. `claim_run` takes
only the work row and commits alone. Every other function here rides its
caller's transaction and leaves the commit to it, so a command's governed write,
its audit event and its queue effect commit together or not at all.

    One row per worker, overwritten: the table is the size of the fleet rather
    than of the uptime. `beat_at` is the store's clock and never the worker's,
    for the reason every other timestamp here is -- a worker with a skewed
    clock would otherwise read as permanently stale or permanently fresh.

    This is not a fenced write and grants nothing. A worker that beats while
    holding no lease still cannot write a run, so the worst a wrong beat does
    is mislead a person.
