-- Plan 3 Task 2: the book entry, a completed run a case writer added to the
-- Book (CONTEXT.md): the desk-wide record of its subject, the analyst-stated
-- classification, and its metrics on each basis, computed by the Model's own
-- calculator when it was added (spec B10), with the limitations the Model
-- served beside them. Written by the Add to Book command
-- (`caos.api.commands.book`) beside its BOOK_ENTRY_ADDED event on the case's
-- audit chain, in one transaction.
--
-- One entry per run, ever (`run_id` unique): a withdrawn entry is not added
-- again, a newer run is. An entry is never deleted or truncated, and the one
-- change it takes is its withdrawal (spec B7): the four withdrawal columns
-- set once, from null, and nothing else touched -- whatever columns the table
-- gains later. `snapshot_sha256` is the digest the adder reviewed (invariant
-- 5, `caos.store.book.snapshot_sha256`): the run's accepted artifacts, its
-- pinned deck and these metrics; the withdrawal is bound to it as well.
--
-- The store keeps its own times: `added_at` and `withdrawn_at` are the
-- clock when the row was written, whatever the writer said, so a later add
-- is never older than an earlier one and a withdrawal never precedes its
-- add; `entry_seq` is the identity the insert drew, the tiebreak for B4's
-- "newest". `issuer_key` is `upper(trim(issuer_id))`, so a Book row's
-- issuer is one spelling (spec B1). Every figure in `metrics` is decimal
-- text or null, by basis and line, never a JSON number (invariant 7).
--
-- Every guard runs with `search_path = pg_catalog, pg_temp` and names its
-- own table through `TG_TABLE_SCHEMA`, as 0050's do; the migration names no
-- schema (DL-1).
