"""Where the store's connection string comes from: an explicit URL, or Lakebase.

Spec section 4 (R11). Locally and in tests `CAOS_DATABASE_URL` is the whole
answer. On Databricks Apps the platform injects `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`,
`PGDATABASE`, `PGUSER` and `PGSSLMODE` for the app's database resource, and
the password is a short-lived credential the SDK mints for the app's service
principal. Tokens live about an hour, so one is refreshed well before that and
every new connection gets a fresh one after it ages out.

The bundle names which Lakebase the credential is for, and exactly one (R24-14):
a Lakebase Autoscaling endpoint (`CAOS_LAKEBASE_ENDPOINT`, the default kind,
minted through the Postgres API) or an existing Provisioned instance
(`CAOS_LAKEBASE_INSTANCE`, through the database API). Neither is preferred:
both, neither, or an endpoint that is not an endpoint's resource path is
`STORE_NOT_CONFIGURED` before anything is minted, so a process configured for
the wrong database refuses at boot rather than connecting as someone else.

Minting is single-flight and bounded (MX-3, DL-4): one caller mints; a caller
that arrives while that mint is in flight is handed the held token when the
server still accepts it (ST-1) and waits for the mint only when there is none;
a mint that has not answered within `MINT_SECONDS` is abandoned as
`STORE_UNAVAILABLE`, a failed mint is not retried for `FAILURE_SECONDS`, and a
token the server still accepts is used until its real expiry when a fresh one
cannot be had. A token is refreshed at `TOKEN_SECONDS` or at the server's
stated expiry, whichever is sooner (ST-3). No lock is held across the network.

An abandoned mint's helper thread keeps running past `MINT_SECONDS`, since
the SDK's token exchange carries no timeout of its own; concurrent helpers
are capped at one (R24-N01), so a mint made while the identity's helper is
still alive does not start a second thread -- it refuses `STORE_UNAVAILABLE`
at once, until that helper ends, rather than piling one up every
`FAILURE_SECONDS`.

No credential is ever printed, logged or written; the URL this returns is
handed straight to the driver.
