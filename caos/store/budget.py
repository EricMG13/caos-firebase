"""Reservations. Invariant 8: every ceiling refuses the next operation.

No provider call without a reservation, and the reservation is taken *before* the
call. A ceiling checked afterwards is an invoice.

Two properties are deliberate and both cost money on purpose:

*The reservation commits on its own.* It does not ride the transaction that later
accepts the artifact. A process that died after the provider completed would
otherwise roll back the record of money that was really spent, and the retry
would reserve against a ceiling that had forgotten it.

*A reservation names its price.* The four `price_*` columns hold the dated
price the amount was computed from (§40). The amount alone cannot be read back
to one -- many prices and request sizes reach the same number -- and the unit
that later spends reads the price back to check that the request it is about to
send still fits what was set aside.

*A Copilot reservation names its credit price* (0048, D77 addendum 2): the
dated price of one AI credit that settles the call's AI units. The run's first
Copilot reservation takes the process's pin, and every later reservation of
that run takes the same price, so a redeploy cannot change a live run's charge
(F592); nothing after the reservation reads the environment's.

*Nothing is released.* An indeterminate call may have reached the provider and
may be billed (`PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` leaves the attempt indeterminate with its
reservation). Releasing it would let the retry spend money the run has
already committed. A retry is a new attempt and a new reservation --
the price of a provider with no idempotency key, paid knowingly.
