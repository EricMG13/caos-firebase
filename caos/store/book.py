"""Book entries in the store (Plan 3 Task 2, `0051_book_entries.sql`).

A book entry is a completed run a case writer added to the Book. These are
the statements the Add to Book and Withdraw commands send inside their
governed unit, under the case lock (`caos.api.commands.book`); none of them
commits. The table's own trigger is the second guard: an entry is inserted
live, never deleted, and changed only by its one withdrawal.

The snapshot digest is what an adder reviews and a withdrawal is bound to
(invariant 5). It binds the inputs and the outputs both (fix rounds 1 and
2): the canonical JSON (`caos.digest`) of the run's accepted artifacts as
sorted `"<route_node_id>:<artifact_sha256>"` lines and of every figure the
entry stores (`EntryFigures`: the deck the run pinned, the currency and
unit, the metrics and the limitations). The Model read serves it over the
handoffs and the figures it shows (`caos.api.reads.model.entry_snapshot`)
and the add recomputes it from the store under the case lock, so a figure
that moved -- another view, another calculator -- is a stale digest; and an
entry's stored digest is the digest of its own row.
