"""The run's event stream: append-only, numbered per run, ordered by a row lock.

`run_events.seq` is per-run monotonic, allocated under the run row lock, and
no event is inserted without the transition it records. The second half is
enforced by the callers in `runs.py`, which append only on a conditional
update that changed a row. The first half is enforced here: `append` takes
the lock itself rather than trusting its caller to have taken it, because
"allocated under the run row lock" is not a comment.

The stream is what the browser tails and the client never reads an event's
payload -- a name triggers a refetch. So an event carries a name and a
position, and nothing a document produced.
