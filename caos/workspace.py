"""The one way this package builds a workspace client (F43).

The SDK's client performs a discovery probe when it is built and retries
under a five-minute budget by default, so every construction here carries
bounded budgets. Authentication is the SDK's unified chain -- the app's
service-principal variables on Databricks Apps, a CLI profile locally -- and
no credential is read by this code.

One client per process and per identity (W2): a client costs host metadata
and OIDC discovery to build, and the SDK refreshes its own token source, so
building one per blob request and twice per health round was three round
trips each. The cache is keyed on the variables that name the workspace and
the principal, never on a secret. A construction that fails raises the typed
`STORE_UNAVAILABLE` (CR-1): the SDK reports an unreachable host or a refused
token as `ValueError`, and nothing above this seam catches that.
