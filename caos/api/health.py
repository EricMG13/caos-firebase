"""`GET /api/health`: readiness over store, bundle and blobs, read from a cache.

The spec's §11 (`docs/rebuild/2026-09-22-caos-databricks-spec.md`). One
background task, started in the app's lifespan, runs the probes every
`PROBE_INTERVAL` seconds; each probe runs on a thread of its own under
`PROBE_DEADLINE`, and a probe whose last run is still alive is never started
again (F47, ED-4). The route reads only what the last round left, so a request
-- anonymous, unguarded, as often as anyone likes -- costs no store connection,
no bundle read and no filesystem call. A round older than `STALE_AFTER` is not
trusted, and before the first round nothing is.

The body is codes and a timestamp only: no path, no URL, no exception text.
A probe that raises is its failure code, and nothing of what it raised.
