"""Start, retry and cancel (Task 4.2 decisions 1, 2 and 7).

These are the only commands that write `run_work`, and none of them calls a
provider: a command enqueues, and the worker's own `execution_input` rechecks
authority before every attempt (authority trace T8). Each is one governed unit
through `run_command` -- state, run event, work row, audit event and receipt
commit together or not at all (T15).

Start and retry classify inside the unit, under the case and run locks, in
decision 7's order, so a caller's mistake is a 409 and never the 503 that
`execution_input` would give a foreign pin (T13):

1. No pin: `RUN_INPUT_NOT_PINNED`.
2. The pin's build, manifest or adapter is not this process's:
   `ORCHESTRATION_BUILD_MOVED`.
3. `execution_input`: the run is not RUNNING, a pinned source is withdrawn, or
   a gate is not approved by a live APPROVER (T4, T6).
4. The verified pin's fingerprint is not the one the caller saw:
   `COMMAND_EXPECTATION_STALE`.
5. `enqueue_run` (`RUN_ALREADY_STARTED`) or `requeue_run` (`RUN_NOT_STOPPED`).
6. The actor already holds `MAX_QUEUED_RUNS_PER_ACTOR` runs queued or in a
   worker's hands: `QUEUED_RUNS_LIMIT_REACHED` (N15).

Cancel needs no authority beyond standing: a run with no work row is queued and
cancelled in the same unit, so it ends CANCELLED before any worker can see it.
A replayed key answers its stored receipt before any of this runs (T12).
