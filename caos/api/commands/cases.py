"""Create case and source admission (Task 4.2 slice 4.2d, decisions 2, 4, 6).

**Create case** (`POST /api/v1/cases`): identity, key, a global role that may
write, then the closed body. One nil-scope unit inserts the case, grants the
creator ADMIN standing and records `CASE_CREATED` beside the receipt -- a
single-actor release under invariant 5.

**Admission** (`POST /api/v1/cases/{case_id}/sources`), in this order:

1. Identity (401), then the envelope from headers alone: `multipart/form-data`
   with a declared `Content-Length` (else `REQUEST_INVALID`) no larger than the
   pack ceiling plus multipart overhead (else 413 `SOURCE_TOO_LARGE`).
2. Key, visibility, global role and the WRITER floor -- so a stranger's pack
   is never parsed, let alone extracted.
3. The standing read's connection is closed (W3), then the form is received
   whole, spooled to disk, with the stream held to its declared length and the
   edge's body deadline: only file parts named `document`, at most
   `max_documents` of them (else `SOURCE_TOO_LARGE`), each filename
   `BoundaryText` of at most 255 characters and not blank. Only then is one of
   `ADMISSION_SLOTS` waited for (N5), so a pack still arriving holds no slot
   and an admission waiting holds no connection, and only with the slot are
   the documents read into memory.
4. A connection of the admission's own is opened; the receipt is looked up for
   the pack's digest and a replay answers without extracting; otherwise
   `prepare_pack` extracts (the §47 child for a PDF) and `put_pack` uploads
   the documents, with no transaction open and no case lock or chain head
   held (ED-5).
5. One governed unit: `admit_prepared`, `SOURCES_ADMITTED` and the receipt.
   A refusal there commits no row; blobs already put are content-addressed
   orphans, kept by design -- deleting governed bytes is the workspace
   volume's retention policy, not this process's (CF-076).
