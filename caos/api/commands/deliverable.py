"""Save, sign, freeze and file one revision (Task 12.1).

The filing chain existed in `caos/deliverable/` and no request path reached
it. Each act is now one command through the shared envelope, and three things
that were the store's remain the store's, checked inside the unit under the
case lock:

1. **Three independent actors.** The signer, the freezer and the filer are
   three different people (`APPROVER_NOT_INDEPENDENT`). The Report section
   composes its controls from what it can see, and a signer whose browser
   still offers "Freeze" is refused here -- persona is not authority.
2. **The digest a request binds** (invariant 5). Every one of the three carries
   the `payload_sha256` its actor reviewed, compared with the stored revision's
   before anything is written; `freeze` and `file` then compare the signature
   and the frozen digest as they always did.
3. **One head per run.** A draft names the revision it was composed against,
   so a save that raced another save is `COMMAND_EXPECTATION_STALE` rather
   than a second head nobody chose; and a head that is frozen and not yet
   filed takes no draft at all (`DELIVERABLE_ALREADY_FROZEN`, W5).

The revision id is minted in the route rather than in the unit, because the
receipt has to name it: a command that minted one inside its transaction could
not answer a replay with the body it first committed.
