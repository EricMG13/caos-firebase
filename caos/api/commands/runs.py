"""Route selection, subject pin, gate preview and approval (Task 4.2 slice 4.2e).

The path names the case and run, `Caller` the actor; the store holds every other
authority fact. Each write is one `run_command` unit under the case lock and
live standing, and first proves the run is the path case's own (a run's case
never changes), so no command locks or writes another case's run. Approval
re-derives the preview under the case and run locks (`release_gate_in`).
