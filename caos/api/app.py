"""The HTTP surface: the section reads, the run tail, and one answer for a
stranger.

Each section read lives in its own module under `caos/api/reads/` (Task 4.1);
the retired run document is now the Run section. The events path is the
socket `caos/api/stream.py`'s contract is served over -- that module already
answers every rule the case stream keeps, and this is where those answers
meet a connection.

The privacy rule is the load-bearing one. A run somebody may not see and a run
that does not exist get the same status and the same body, because 403 is the
informative answer and that is exactly its problem: it confirms the id names
something real. `NOT_AUTHENTICATED` is different in kind -- "I do not know who
you are" discloses nothing about any case -- so it is answered plainly, and a
client that got a 404 for it would retry the wrong thing forever.

Responses are named models with `extra="forbid"` in both directions. A response
shape that let an extra key through is how a store column reaches a browser
because somebody widened a SELECT.

FastAPI's own `/docs`, `/redoc` and `/openapi.json` are not served (Task 4.5
decision 6): Swagger loads a script from a CDN the policy refuses, and a route
map is nothing a browser of this workspace needs. Every request passes
`caos/api/edge.py`'s guard first -- the platform or the loopback rule, the
identity-header hygiene, the Origin check -- before routing or identity.

# a code a future route raises must not inherit 400 from a lookup default,
# because "your request was wrong" is a claim about the caller and nothing
# chose it. The server's own faults are 5xx: it cannot answer, whoever asks,
# and a 400 would tell the caller their request was the problem.
#
# Which 5xx is the owner's D3 decision (17 September 2026). One status had been
# carrying two claims: "this is not your request's fault" and "come back
# later". Only the second is what 503 means on the wire, so a proxy read every
# server fault as worth retrying, including the ones no amount of retrying
# reaches. The split asks one question per code -- would the identical
# request, later, with nobody doing anything in between, plausibly succeed? --
# and a fault only an operator can repair answers no, because the client's
# waiting is not what repairs it.
#
# The store not answering is the whole of the yes side, with the provider not
# answering beside it since the owner's second half (§88). `STREAM_LIMIT_REACHED`
# joins it for the same reason and not by analogy: the capacity is released by
# a watcher closing a tail, so waiting is exactly what repairs it. Nothing an
# operator does is required. `CONCURRENCY_LIMIT_REACHED` (CF-051) is the same
# shape one level up: the capacity is released by another request finishing,
# not by anything an operator does either. Everything else at 500 is stored
# bytes failing verification against what this server itself wrote, a pinned
# input the run cannot change, or an operator's repair; each `CLEARS` entry
# beside it already says as much in words before the status agreed.
