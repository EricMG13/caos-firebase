"""The edge guard: what a request must prove before anything else reads it.

The spec's §4 (`docs/rebuild/2026-09-22-caos-databricks-spec.md`) and D10 in
`docs/rebuild/decisions.md`. D10: the platform is the edge. The legacy host's
static shared secret, and the signed per-request HMAC assertion that replaced
it, are both gone (spec §54); a deployment is either behind a Databricks App
or it is a loopback development image, and there is no third thing.

**The platform's contract.** Databricks Apps authenticates the caller with
OIDC ahead of this process and forwards the caller's own access token in
`x-forwarded-access-token`; `caos/api/identity.py` resolves who that token
names with SCIM. It passes `origin`, `sec-fetch-*`, `idempotency-key`,
`last-event-id`, `content-type` and `content-length` through.

**Two modes, decided by the environment on every use.**

- *Platform mode* (`PLATFORM_ENV` set): the workspace id must be configured
  and any declared `CAOS_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` or `DATABRICKS_HOST` well-formed, or
  boot refuses `EDGE_CONFIG_INVALID`. Every identity header a request arrived
  with is dropped before routing, identity or body -- a header a misconfigured
  proxy forwarded decides nothing -- and the caller is whoever the workspace's
  `Me` names for the forwarded token.
- *Dev mode* (`PLATFORM_ENV` unset): served only when both socket ends are
  loopback addresses and `Host` is `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]`. A
  published port on this image therefore answers health and nothing else, and
  a DNS rebinding page is refused by its `Host`. `caos/api/identity.py` reads
  `x-caos-user` and, only while `CAOS_TRUST_ROLE_HEADER` is on, `x-caos-role`;
  a peer that passes the loopback check is otherwise READER. An unsafe `/api`
  request's origin must be the conventional vite-plus-loopback-API pair
  (`DEV_ORIGINS`: ports 5173 and 8000) unless `CAOS_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` declares a
  different one (CF-056), which must be well-formed or boot refuses
  `EDGE_CONFIG_INVALID`.

In both modes a repeated or lookalike identity header is 401
`NOT_AUTHENTICATED`; `/api` is checked for Origin and `Sec-Fetch-Site` (the
second half of Task 4.2's CSRF split); and every response carries the
security headers and policy, with no cookie and no CORS header.

No header value is ever logged, formatted into a body or compared in a way
that would need constant time: the refusal bodies are constants, and an
unhandled fault is logged as its class and the frame it was raised in, never
its message (AS-6).
