"""Book, `/api/v1/book`: the credit, across the portfolio.

Portfolio-scoped, so the path names no case. The rows are the cases the caller
holds live standing on, read exactly as Directory reads them, and each row's
cells are values the accepted CP-CF projection already carries -- re-derived by
`caos.api.reads.model.accepted_forecast`, the one reader the Model section
uses too. This module computes no figure and reaches no verdict: it names the
columns its own calculator declares, and answers each passport field from the
accepted record, the pinned run subject, or the host's declaration of its own
arithmetic.

A credit whose projection read refuses does not decide the others: the typed
code and its host `clears` constant become that row's `refusal`, while
`unavailable_reason` says only that no forecast was accepted. The two are
separate fields because a refusal and an unrun forecast are different answers.
No document-derived text is carried.
