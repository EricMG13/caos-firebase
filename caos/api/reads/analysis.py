"""The Analysis section read (Task 4.1, slice 4.1e).

Every accepted handoff of the displayed run, in route order, each read through
`accepted_handoff`: the record must bind its exact Markdown, the identity the
store rebuilds, this build and the accepted lineage, and nothing is re-anchored
(§42.4). Each is labelled per §46.3 -- `source_facts` are the host-verified
citations with withdrawal read live, `model_analysis` is the model's exact
Markdown, and `host_calculation` is `NONE`. Beside the Markdown, each serves
the tagged tables it carries, read from those same bytes by the bundle's own
reader (`caos.methodology.tables`): exact text, and `Decimal` figures where the
bundle reads a figure -- or no table and a typed reason. Nothing is stored and
the Markdown stays the authority. A node without an accepted handoff
is listed as pending with its recomputed state and makes the document partial;
on a run a validated Blocked verdict ended, `blocked_by` names which of those
nodes answered, because a Blocked verdict accepts nothing (§68).
A run of another case, an unknown and a malformed run are one `RUN_NOT_FOUND`.
