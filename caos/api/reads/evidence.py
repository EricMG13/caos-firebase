"""The evidence page read (Phase 4 Task 4.4, slice 4.4c; decision 7).

`GET /api/v1/cases/{case_id}/runs/{run_id}/sources/{source_id}/pages/{page}`
serves one page's text layer and frame (`caos/evidence/page.py`). Identity is
checked first, then READER standing on the case -- an unknown, malformed,
unauthorised or revoked case is one private `CASE_NOT_FOUND` -- then that the
run is the case's (`RUN_NOT_FOUND` otherwise). Everything about the source and
the page, including a page outside 1..`PAGE_MAX` and a malformed source id, is
the same 404 `PAGE_NOT_AVAILABLE` with no text. Not a section document, so
no chrome; never cached. Standing and the page's rows are read in one read
unit, which `read_page` ends before the document is read and its frame
extracted, so no transaction is held across the extraction.
