"""The Model section: the credit model of the displayed run's accepted CP-1,
with CP-2G and CP-CF's projections where the route ran them, on the v1 wire.

Every figure is the host calculator's (`caos.calculators.credit_model`), read
from the accepted handoffs' tagged tables at request time and served 1:1:
the columns, the lines in their bands, each cell an exact decimal string or
the reason it has none, and the limitations the cells note. A projection
reads the rate deck the run pinned at its creation, never a newer one. A
CP-1 cell's `[C<n>]` marker resolves to CP-1's own citation (D107). New
forecast assumptions resolve the exact bound quote from their accepted owner.

Before CP-1 is accepted the body is empty and says the handoffs are pending
(spec M1). The accepted CP-CF record stays beside the model for comparison,
re-derived as the Book reads it. A source withdrawn from any accepted
handoff's citations refuses the whole read (spec B8). A bridge the
calculator's own check finds open does not refuse an assist model: it is a
visible limitation, and a log line with the case, the run and the count.
Nor do model tables it cannot use (logged by module and code): unreadable
CP-1 tables, as an older run's, serve the accepted CP-CF record without a
model; unreadable or withheld CP-2G drivers hold the business units flat;
a model past the grid's bounds serves the record without a grid; and a cell
whose figure runs past the wire's 64 characters is withheld. Each is a
stated limitation and a log line with no figure.

In its default view the body carries the snapshot digest Add to Book is
bound to (invariant 5; `caos.store.book.snapshot_sha256`): the handoffs it
shows and every figure an entry stores of it (`entry_figures`: the pinned
deck, the currency and unit, the book metrics and the limitations); with
unrealised add-backs excluded, or with no grid, it carries none. `model_grid`
and `entry_figures` are how that command assembles and stores the same model
(spec B10).

A caller without standing reads the model of a run with a live book entry
when the request names it (`deps.visible_run`, spec B9), read-only: Analysis'
chrome with no standing and no actions, and no snapshot digest, so the
document offers nothing an Add to Book could bind.
