Report names its revision or not. Named, it is served exactly as Committee

# Three-node LITE: isolation/standing/selection (3), live proof (40). No lock:
# a read takes none, and the payload digest below is the consistency check.
# Committee adds publication/signatures (2) and three actor/audit proof reads.
# Filed Committee also adds receipt/audit (5) and saved payload (1).
# Task 12.1 adds two to each: the publication row and the signatures the
# section's four filing actions are judged from. Proving a filing act costs one
# more read per actor it looks for -- the receipts that actor committed on this
# case, which is how an event written by a command is rebuilt (`payload_digests`)
# -- so a frozen revision pays two, one signer and its freezer, and a filed one
# pays a third for its filer.
# The figures below are therefore stated **for one signer**, which is the only
# shape any fixture has and no longer the only shape the store allows: the
# opinions table is keyed per signer and `sign_opinion_in` refuses only a frozen
# revision, so a second approver may sign before the freeze and costs one more
# read. Measured at 53 for the frozen path with two signers. Recorded in
# CLAUDE.md rather than absorbed into the number, because a budget fitted to the
# widest shape stops measuring the common one.
# The head a save is judged against rides the revision's own statement, so it
# costs no round trip. "unsaved" is a run with no revision, measured on the
# same LITE route: isolation and standing (2), the head (1), the run and its
# title (1), and the payload derivation a first save would make (38) -- the
# derivation the saved path proves, less the stored revision's own reads.
# Every path that finds a revision lists the run's revisions too (1), so a
# committee member can reach a frozen one from Report; "unsaved" has none.
# FP-34: `read_filed_receipt` now re-checks OPINION_SIGNED and
# DELIVERABLE_FROZEN provenance itself rather than trusting `_publication`'s
# own pass alone, one more `payload_digests` read per signer and the freezer
# -- the same one signer, one freezer shape the rest of this budget is stated
# for -- so "committee" pays two more for a filed revision.
