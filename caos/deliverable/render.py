"""The deliverable: one HTML file, and a render that originates nothing.

The host renders from the frozen snapshot -- the accepted artifacts in route
order, every figure carrying its citation, then the analyst's narrative and
the module provenance index.

The structural claim is the one worth protecting: *the render is a function of
frozen bytes*. It takes a payload and returns a page. It has no store, no
connection and no clock, so there is no editorial boundary to police -- nothing
here can reach past the payload to fetch something newer, prettier or different.
That is what `test_the_deliverable_renders_from_the_frozen_payload_alone`
enforces by rendering with the store closed.

The consequence is deliberate: both sides of an unresolved conflict, `Restricted`
and `SCREENING_ONLY` qualifications reach the page exactly as the artifacts carry
them. A render that tidied them would be originating an opinion.

It prints to paper. No PDF, deck, dashboard or workbook, and no network: a page
that fetched a stylesheet would render differently the day the stylesheet moved,
and this file has to render the same in ten years.

    a construct `ELEMENTS` names and Markdown defines as literal. And
    **delimiters close in the order they opened**: `*a **b* c**` produced
    `<em>a <strong>b</em> c</strong>`, which is not well-formed. A delimiter
