    """Return the stored receipt in the caller's authorized read or write unit.

    The caller owns authorization, its own unit and transaction cleanup, as for
    `prove_revision`: a write caller holds the case lock, the filed Committee
    section read holds none, so the audit-head comparison below reads across
    snapshots and a governed write committing mid-read makes it refuse rather
    than serve bytes it cannot prove. Historical renderer pins remain valid.
    Legacy filings without bytes refuse.

    **A filed record is served from its own bytes, never from live state.** This
    re-ran `prove_revision` against the current sources, the current
    `vendor/deploy-v` and the current narrative rules, and refused with the codes
    tampering produces when any of the three moved -- so a WRITER withdrawing a
    source, a routine bundle upgrade or a tightened narrative rule each locked
    every filed record out of the Committee section permanently, with remediation
    advice offered for a record that is immutable (FP-05). What is proven here is
    what a filed record *is*: the frozen payload still hashes to the digest the
    receipt names, the receipt bytes are the ones the host wrote, the three roles
    are independent, and the `OPINION_SIGNED`, `DELIVERABLE_FROZEN` and
    `DELIVERABLE_FILED` links are all in one verified audit chain whose head has
    not moved (FP-34: `deliverable_opinions` and `deliverable_publications` are
    consistent with each other by construction here, but consistency is not
    provenance -- `sign_opinion_in` and `freeze_in` write only those rows, and a
    caller composing its own envelope around them, as this repository's own
    convenience wrappers do not, could commit either with no audit event at
    all). Filing itself re-proves the revision under the case lock
    (`caos/api/commands/deliverable.py`), which is where a live re-derivation
    belongs.
