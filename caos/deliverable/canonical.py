"""The deliverable's canonical payload, read from the store and bound to it.

A canonical artifact's identity is the pair (`artifact_sha256`, `record_sha256`),
and the record is never read back as fact. Every accepted artifact of the
pinned route is read in route order through
`read_record` against the identity the host rebuilds from its pins; its Markdown
is re-validated and must project exactly what the record says; every recorded
citation is re-anchored in the run's pinned evidence and must land on exactly
the recorded rectangles.

The payload carries each pair beside the exact Markdown and record text, so its
digest -- what an opinion signs and a freeze binds -- binds both hashes, and
`verify_package` checks each pair with the standard library alone. Freezing and
verifying re-derive the payload from the store, so a moved hash refuses. The
render stays pure: nothing here is reachable from it.
