"""The one model factory: every production call goes through Databricks AI Gateway.

Spec section 3 (D7, D8). `chat_model` returns the LangChain chat model the host
talks to -- `ChatDatabricks` against the configured serving endpoint -- and
`ChatCompletions` adapts it to the `CompletionProvider` seam the canonical
executor was built on, so nothing downstream of this module knows which vendor
answered. Tests inject another `BaseChatModel` through `completions(chat=...)`;
the app package never imports one.

Two things differ from the legacy transport and are decided here, not hidden.
The charge is computed: a gateway response carries token counts, not money, so
the call is billed as `tokens x the dated price` under one Decimal context
(invariant 7). The generation id is the response's own when it names one; a
response that does not is given a host-minted one, prefixed so a reader can
tell, because an accepted artifact must be able to say what produced it
(invariant 3) and a blank would be refused outright.
