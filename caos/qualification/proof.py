"""`ORCHESTRATION_PROOF`: the one thing the host may assert about itself.

Three claims define it — the pinned methodology ran as pinned, against the
pinned sources, and every citation re-located. Every one of those is a fact
this repository holds the records for,
which is exactly why it is the word the host is allowed to say. The other word
(`QUALIFIED`) is a reviewer's, and nothing here reaches it.

**Re-derived, never read back.** Each claim was already checked once, when the
artifact was written: the route was pinned before execution, the authority was
verified on the bytes at use, the citations were anchored before they reached
the envelope. The value of checking them again is that the store may have moved
since — a source withdrawn, a bundle replaced, a token index rebuilt. A proof
that trusted the recorded answer would attest that something was recorded, which
is not the claim anybody needs.

So the digests the artifacts carry are treated as *expectations*, re-verified
against the store (invariant 3), and the module each node ran is read from the
route pin rather than from the artifact that claims it.

**A proof over nothing is refused.** Three claims about a run with no accepted
artifacts all hold vacuously, and the strongest-looking proof this module could
ever return would be one about a run that never ran. `CLAUDE.md`: a change that
makes an invariant pass vacuously is wrong even with a green suite.

**Every run is canonical**: an artifact is proven
through its host record and nothing else -- an artifact without one refuses
`ARTIFACT_RECORD_MISMATCH`, and none is parsed as claims. Both blobs are read,
the record must bind this Markdown and the identity rebuilt from the store, its
adapter, build, manifest and authority must be the pin's and the bundle's, the
Markdown re-validated must project exactly what the record says, and every
recorded anchored citation must re-anchor in the run's pinned, live sources on
exactly the recorded rectangles. A record's unverified citations (D106) are
the module's own locators: carried as recorded, never re-anchored, never
counted as re-located, and never meet an answer key. The
sources (`pinned_live_sources`) and the call-time identity (`call_time_identity`)
are the ones `caos/deliverable/canonical.py` reads, so both reach the same
verdict, under the proof's codes.
