"""A qualification set as a declared form on disk, and the loader that reads it.

`CLAUDE.md`'s Phase 10 ledger asked for this: a set that lives only in memory is
enough for a digest to be checkable and not enough for two people to be sure
they hold the same set, and once a case carried its documents as bytes, writing
one in Python stopped being reasonable at any real size.

**A directory, not a file.** A case carries documents, and documents are bytes.
Base64 inside one JSON file would make the set unreadable to the reviewer who is
supposed to check it; a directory lets them open the documents. So the form is a
manifest naming its cases, and the documents beside it:

    acme-q3/
      qualification.json
      documents/acme-2026/report.txt
      documents/borealis-2026/report.txt

**The digest does not move.** `qualification_set_digest` already covers each
document's filename and the hash of its bytes, so a set read from here digests
exactly as the same set built in Python -- which is the property that lets a
verdict's `qualification_set_sha256` name a directory someone is holding. The
loader adds nothing to the digest and takes nothing away; it only produces the
same dataclasses from bytes rather than from a literal.

**A document's filename is its path's last segment.** One field rather than two,
because two would be two things that can disagree and the digest covers the
filename -- a manifest that named a document `report.txt` while reading
`other.txt` would digest as the first and admit the second.

**Read the way a verdict is read.** The manifest is authored, possibly not here
and possibly years from now, so it gets the treatment `caos/qualification/
verdict.py` gives a signed document: a closed shape, undeclared keys refused,
nothing coerced. Malformed is one code because it has one remedy -- fix the
file. A path leaving the set's own directory is the exception, and is kept apart
because its remedy is not the same and neither is its seriousness.

**What it does not do.** It does not judge whether the set measures anything:
`assert_measurable` is the one place that rule lives (`matrix.py`), and the
harness applies it before it spends. A loader that re-stated it would be the
second copy that drifts.
