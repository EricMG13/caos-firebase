"""Invariant 11: the host re-locates the quote, and refuses one it cannot.

A citation as a module offers it is `{source_id, page, matched_text}`. What
reaches an artifact is that plus the coordinates the host derived by finding the
quote in its own token index. The module never supplies a rectangle, because a
rectangle it supplied would be a claim nobody checked.

Two rules make the search honest:

*Exactly once.* A quote found twice is refused rather than resolved to the first
match. Highlighting one of two identical sentences asserts a precision the host
does not have.

*Never across a region.* Matching joins tokens within a line and continues only
onto the next line of the same region. Two columns are two regions, so a phrase
cannot be assembled across the gutter between them -- which is what a naive
scan of page text does, and what it silently produces is a quote that exists
nowhere on the page.

*One whole line, where an answer was accepted until D105* (N28,
`WHOLE_LINE`). The final check told a module that `matched_text` is the
complete text of one evidence line, and the host held it to that: a quote
anchored only on a line as the module was shown it, word for word (W6, N13).
Any unique run anchored before, so a fragment that dropped a "not" was shown
as a host-verified source fact (AI-4). A record names the rule it was
accepted under and is re-anchored by it (`ANY_RUN` when it names none,
`WHOLE_LINE_AS_STORED` for N28's first reading), so no stored record starts
refusing.

*An excerpt of one line, where an answer is accepted since D105* (`EXCERPT`).
The owner ruled that a citation need not be the entire line, only trace a
statement to where it came from: `matched_text` is an exact excerpt of one
evidence line as shown -- at least `MIN_EXCERPT_WORDS` consecutive whole
words, or the whole line when it is shorter -- found once on its page, and
anchored to that line, which the record keeps beside it (`line_text`). The
eight contiguous words stop the AI-4 fragment only where the dropped "not"
would sit inside the run, which then no longer matches; a qualifier at the
excerpt's edge ("believe that the Company will be able to refinance ...",
its "do not" left before it) is still an excerpt. The guard there is the
full source line shown around every excerpt -- delivered with EX2, which
this rule merges with. A quote running past its line's end is no excerpt.

The result is one rectangle per line the quote covers, the shape a PDF
highlight's QuadPoints uses and for the same reason: selected text wraps, and a
single enclosing rectangle would cover text the quote does not contain.

    `rule` is how each is located (`CitationRule`): an answer being accepted

    record is re-anchored by the rule it names. Each anchored citation
    carries the line it anchored in (`AnchoredCitation.line_text`).

    Called before an artifact is written, never after: an artifact naming a quote
    nobody can find is the thing invariant 11 exists to prevent, and one that has
    already been stored is a correction rather than a refusal.

    A citation may only name evidence actually delivered to that node --
    a real source in the same case is still something this node was not given.
    `delivered` maps each source to the exact blocks the node was handed. Under
    `ANY_RUN` the match must lie wholly within delivered lines: a quote on an
    undelivered page, or wrapping onto an undelivered line, refuses
    `CITATION_NOT_DELIVERED`. Under `WHOLE_LINE` (and `EXCERPT`, whose match
    is within one block) a match is exactly one block,
    and delivery is judged against that one block (R24-16): the prompt calls a
    shown block whole citable evidence, and a page map may show a source line's
    first block while withholding its continuation, so requiring the *line's*
    every block would refuse a quote of exactly what was shown. Ambiguity is
    still counted over the whole page, so a quote repeated on a line the node
    never saw is ambiguous rather than resolved to the copy it did -- over every
    run of the page under `ANY_RUN`, over every line of it under `WHOLE_LINE`.

    An artifact carries many citations and they cluster: several quotes from one
    page of one source is the normal shape. Both lookups are therefore fetched
    once per distinct page and per distinct source rather than once per citation,
    avoiding the N+1 shape that runs ~8x slower on exactly this kind of list.
    A caller verifying several lists in one unit
    passes one `TokenIndex` to share those reads across them.

    Under `WHOLE_LINE` and `EXCERPT` (`REANCHORING_RULES`) a quote that is no
    line, or no excerpt, of its cited page but is one, delivered, of exactly
    one other delivered page of its source is anchored there, at its true
    page, and the page the module named is kept beside it as `cited_page`
    (D94, `_true_page`): the coordinate stored is always where the quote is
    (invariant 11). Two such places, or one the node was not given, still
    refuse `CITATION_NOT_LOCATED`. The retry placement (`find_line`) and a
    stored record's re-check (`verify_stored_citations`) never re-anchor.
