"""Why a glyph a PDF lays out may not be seen on the rendered page (N27).

pdfminer lays out every glyph a content stream shows, however it is painted,
so six kinds of text a reader of the rendered page does not see arrive as
ordinary words: text in render mode 3, painted neither filled nor stroked --
which is also the text layer every OCR'd scan carries over its image -- text
painted in the colour already behind it, glyphs too small to read, text
inside optional content the document switches off, text the page paints
over later, and text painted in a colorant that paints nothing. They stay
evidence, because a scan's only text is its invisible layer, and the
extractor marks each line that carries one with why (`pdf._line_tokens`), so
the approver and the model can weigh it.

`MarkingAggregator` is pdfminer's page aggregator watching the paint in
drawing order: each string's render mode and em on the page -- on its
narrower axis (N9) -- the colours it is painted in, what the page's filled
paths had painted under each glyph when it was drawn, the marked-content
sequences it is drawn in, and -- looking forward -- the opaque rectangles the
page fills over it afterwards. Behind a glyph no filled path covers is paper,
white; an image's colours are not read, so what is behind a glyph drawn on one
is not compared. `MarkingInterpreter` is pdfminer's interpreter deciding what
that device cannot see: whether an `/OC` sequence is optional content the
document's default configuration switches off (`OptionalContent`), read
against the resources in force; the clip and transparency a fill is painted
under (`PaintState`); and the colours of an `Indexed` or `Separation` space
pdfminer names without reading (`read_space`, N9), or that a `Separation` or
`DeviceN` space paints none (`ColorantNone`).

It is a reading of the paint, not a rendering: where a viewer could differ --
a clip of any shape but a rectangle, a transparency group, a soft mask, a
shading, an image -- nothing is marked, and a mark is a note to weigh, never a
refusal.
