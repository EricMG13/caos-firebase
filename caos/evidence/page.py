"""One page of a run's pinned live source, as its text layer and frame.

Phase 4 Task 4.4 decisions 7 and 8. A page is served only from a source that is
live now and a member of the run's pinned source-set version with the document
and extraction identity the pin captured -- the `_RUN_BLOCKS_QUERY` join of
`caos/evidence/read.py` (invariant 1: withdrawal is checked at every use).
Its lines are the token index citations were anchored in, grouped by
`(region_id, line_id)`: the joined words and their union rectangle, in the
coordinates the tokens are stored in (invariant 11). No renderer draws the page.

The frame says what those coordinates are, read from the digest-verified
document under the stored extractor identity: a `caos.pdfminer` row's from v2
on (`PDF_CROP_VERSIONS`) are crop-relative with y down (§44.3), a v1 row's are
pdfminer's layout space with y up (§44.4), and a `caos.plain-text` row's are
the cells of its recorded fixed pitch. PDF frames come from the §47 child, and
a crop that child has already answered for a document is remembered in process
(`FRAME_CACHE_SIZE`): it is derived from a digest-addressed document and a page
number, so it cannot go stale, and the child costs an interpreter each time.

The store is read first and the read unit is ended before the document is
read or the child is run, so an extraction that takes seconds holds no
transaction or snapshot on the request's connection. That costs invariant 1
nothing. The membership row is a plain read with no lock, so a withdrawal
committed after it was never excluded by holding the transaction open: the
check is the read's, at the instant of the read, whether the extraction runs
inside that unit or after it. What is served after it is the stored lines that
read returned and a frame -- four numbers and an axis, no document text --
derived from bytes that are content-addressed and re-verified against the pin
by `BlobStore.get`, so nothing the extraction produces depends on the store.

Everything unavailable -- not pinned, withdrawn, re-extracted, a page the
document does not have, bytes that no longer hash to the pin, a child that
refused -- is one `PAGE_NOT_AVAILABLE`, raised outside any `except` so no
chain carries text (invariant 2). A stored identity no reader here knows is
the server's own row failing, `SOURCE_IDENTITY_INVALID`.
