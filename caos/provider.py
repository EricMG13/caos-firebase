"""The provider seam: one prompt in, one `Completion` out, a closed set of refusals.

What the canonical executor depends on and nothing more. The transport that
answers lives behind `caos/models.py` (Databricks AI Gateway through the one
model factory); this module holds the shape both sides agree on: the request
and response ceilings, the request bytes a call is priced on, the refusal a
finish reason maps to, and the rule that a charge is exact known money or
unknown -- never a float, never a guess (invariant 7).

Nothing here quotes a response. A completion echoes the prompt and the prompt
carries evidence, so a refusal that included the body -- or a vendor's error
string, which often contains it -- would be the leak `caos/refusals.py` exists
to prevent.
