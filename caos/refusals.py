Error handling is ~2x worse in agent-written code, and the failure is always
the same shape: an exception string
carrying a document's contents, a vendor's name or a filesystem path into a log
line or an HTTP body. A Refusal carries a code from a closed set and nothing
else, so there is no string to leak.
