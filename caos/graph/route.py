"""Route resolution: pure, from typed edges, and pinned once.

That the route is typed is the reason this module is built before anything
that depends on it. The predecessor resolved routes from
`navigation.dependencies` -- 97 untyped pairs meant for display -- so 25
OPTIONAL and 22 ADVISORY edges were enforced as mandatory, the single QA_GATE
did not gate, and RESTRICTED could not occur. Nothing here reads that list;
the typed set is `profile["edges"]`.

Three rules carry the phase:

*Blocking and soft.* REQUIRED, CONDITIONAL and QA_GATE block. OPTIONAL and
ADVISORY degrade their target to RESTRICTED -- which **runs**, carrying its
limitation forward -- unless the edge's source module is READY or
READY_WITH_LIMITATIONS, at which point the evidence exists and running without it
would discard what the case has.

*Readiness is read, never passed.* It comes from the accepted CP-0 artifact's
readiness rows, typed as a `NodeResult` (adopting CAOS-Final §18). A caller
able to assert readiness could assert its way past the gate that measures it.

*Resolution is pure.* No I/O, no clock. The resolved route is digested at the
plan gate and execution reads only the pin, so a replay from the same pins takes
the same path (invariant 10).
