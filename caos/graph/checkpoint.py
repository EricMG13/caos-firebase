"""The LangGraph checkpointer: Lakebase on Databricks, the store's Postgres locally.

Spec section 4. Checkpoints live in their own schema (`caos_graph`) so the
store's verified migration prefix never sees them: the ledger is the host's
schema, the checkpoint tables are LangGraph's, and neither audits the other.

On Databricks the saver runs over a small pool whose every new connection
carries a credential minted at that moment through `store_url()` -- the same
`PG*` values and the same minting the store itself uses (F30). The vendor
`CheckpointSaver` was tried first: its pool fixes `port=5432 sslmode=require`
in its own connection string and offers no override, so the platform's
`PGPORT`/`PGSSLMODE`, and any stand-in database, could never reach it.

The saver deserialises exactly one extension type, the graph's own `RunState`
(SA-C2, ST-14): LangGraph's default serializer imports and calls any callable a
checkpoint row names, so a crafted row would run code in the worker, and its
allowlisted form still builds LangGraph's "safe" types and `json` rows'
LangChain objects. Anything else a row names refuses `INTERNAL_FAULT`.
Set-up is serialised across processes under an advisory lock (AR-20), bounded
by a statement and lock timeout (ST-4), and a pool that fails to set up is
closed before the refusal leaves (CR-2). Off the platform the saver runs over
the same small checked pool, so a session the server ended is replaced rather
than failing every later claim (ST-13).
