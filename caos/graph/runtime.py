"""One node at a time over the pinned route; recovery is recomputation.

Execution state *is* the accepted-attempt ledger (legacy decision §3, refined
by D6): LangGraph drives the nodes and checkpoints its own position, but every
pass recomputes `node_states` over the rows that survived, and a node that
completed is not run again because it is COMPLETE, not because something
remembered it. `caos/graph/build.py` is the graph; this module is what each of
its nodes does, and what the terminal node decides.

The order inside one pass is deliberate and is invariant 8's shape:

    check the context  ->  start the attempt  ->  reserve  ->  call  ->  accept

The attempt row exists before the call because it is the identity the call is
charged against. The reservation is taken before the call and commits on its own,
because a call that reached the provider is billable whether or not this process
lived to record it (`caos/store/budget.py`).
