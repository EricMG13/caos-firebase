"""One PostgreSQL-backed worker: poll, claim a run, drive it, map the outcome.

Brief 4.3 D9. No broker, no LISTEN/NOTIFY, no listener: lease expiry has to be
polled anyway, and the work row is the whole queue. A claim is per run (D1), so
this process is the run's only writer until its lease is lost, and every write
it makes is fenced by the lease token (D3).

`stopping` is checked between nodes -- before a node's context check, so before
its attempt, reservation or call -- between polls, and before a rate-limited
call is sent again (ST-7), never during a call. A call in flight when SIGTERM
arrives is billed and accepted only if it answers within the drain's join
(`caos.serve.LIMIT_JOIN_SECONDS`); past that it is abandoned with its
reservation held, and the run is reclaimed once its lease expires (ST-15).
