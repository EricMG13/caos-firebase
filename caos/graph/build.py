"""The pinned route as a LangGraph graph (spec section 4, D5, D6).

One graph per run, built from the pinned `ResolvedRoute`: one node per route
node in dependency order, chained so nodes run one at a time, then a terminal
node that decides COMPLETE or BLOCKED from the store. LangGraph owns
execution, thread identity and checkpoints; the accepted-attempt ledger stays
the only truth for what ran. Every node re-derives its own state from the
store before doing anything, so a resumed thread, a fresh invocation of the
same run, or a crash between nodes all converge on the same answer
(invariant 6): a node that completed is skipped because it is COMPLETE in the
ledger, not because a checkpoint remembered it.

The chain is the dependency order rather than a fan-out of the typed edges
because the frontier is recomputed from the store at each node: by the time a
node is visited every source of every edge into it has been visited, so
"may this node run now" is exactly the legacy frontier question, answered one
node at a time. Running independent nodes at once is future work (next.md N1).
