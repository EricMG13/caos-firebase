"""Running one canonical module: a conforming Markdown handoff and its record (§41).

One pre-call read unit and one post-call read unit around the call. The
attempt, the stored input, the pinned route and node, the pinned adapter and
the host identity are read in one unit before the call and again after it;
the upstream the prompt named must be unchanged. The call is billed before any
analysis, with the exact response body addressed as the call's diagnostic
(§42.3), so a refused or Blocked handoff still says what was said -- and after
a crash the answer is accepted, blocked or explained from it, never paid for
again (`replay_billed`, brief 4.3 D7).
Then the handoff must be the vendor's conforming Markdown for exactly this
invocation. Each citation is anchored in the delivered evidence or kept as
unverified beside it, in a list of its own (D106): a citation's fault refuses
the citation, never the answer, so invariant 11's "coordinate-anchored or
refused" holds of every citation and the record's anchored list holds only
anchored ones.
