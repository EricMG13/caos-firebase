"""CP-1, CP-2G and CP-CF tagged tables read into the credit model's typed inputs.

A row's figure is the host's own reading of the cell (`TableCell.value`, read
with `Decimal`, invariant 7); the cell's text stands verbatim, `[C<n>]` markers
kept, in its `SourceRef` (D107). An enumerated column's text that names a
member of its closed vocabulary on case and separators (`_`, `-` and
whitespace alike) reads as that member's canonical spelling, so
`DEBT_ADJUSTMENT` is `DEBT ADJUSTMENT`; any other text reads in upper case.

A table the run did not write reads as no rows, except the period register:
the currency and unit every figure is in come from it, so without it nothing
reads. A present table missing a column it needs, a row whose width is not its
header's, a null in a required enumerated column, or a period register stating
two currencies or two units, is `HANDOFF_MALFORMED`; so is one register id
twice in one period, two periods for one fiscal quarter, YTD or year, a
fiscal year without a four-digit year, more than `MAX_PERIODS` periods, a
period naming one component twice or nesting components more than
`MAX_NESTING` deep (or in a cycle), a fiscal year outside 1900-2200 or more
than a year from its period's end date's year, a start or end date that is
not a `YYYY-MM-DD` calendar date in 1900-2200, a start after the end, a day
count that is not the dates' own (end - start + 1) or not positive, a figure
that is not finite, of `MAX_FIGURE` or more in size, or written to more than
`MAX_DECIMALS` decimals (never rounded silently), a negative facility
carrying value other than a `DEBT ADJUSTMENT` row's (CP-MODEL's
`validate_cp_model_inputs` rule), a negative facility commitment or drawing
(on any row), a negative RCF commitment or drawing, and one READY growth
driver written twice for a case, year and slot. The rate and amortisation
columns the CP-1 fork added (owner-authorised 2026-10-10) are absent from an
older run's debt register: they read as `NOT_STATED` or no value, never as a
fault. A rate term written in the wrong unit (a spread or floor written with
`%` or not a whole number of basis points, a fixed coupon outside 0-30
percent) is kept as read, the row flagged `terms_out_of_range`. A fixed
coupon is CP-1's decimal percent (`6.500`): 0 is a zero-coupon convertible,
as stated. On a `FIXED` row, a coupon strictly between 0 and 0.5 written
without `%` is either a decimal fraction written in place of the percent
(`0.065` for 6.500) or a genuine sub-half-percent coupon (`0.250`), and the
row's `margin_or_coupon` text decides: a percent it shows is a decimal
figure followed by a marker, `%`, the fullwidth percent sign (U+FF05) or
"per cent" / "percent" in any letter case (`6.5%`, `6.500 %`, `0.25 per
cent.`; not "percentage"). A figure with a digit, a point, a comma or a sign
before it (`16.5%`, `.5%`, `6,5%`, `-6.5%`) shows no percent. A figure equal
to the coupon times 100 (and none equal to the coupon) reads it times 100, flagged
`coupon_as_fraction`, the figure read then in range from 0.5 to 30; a figure
equal to the coupon itself (and none equal to the times-100 figure) reads it
as stated, unflagged, in range from 0 to 30. Where no text decides (none, no
percent in it, no figure equal to either, or both readings shown) the coupon
is kept as written and the row flagged `terms_out_of_range`: the rate is the
implied rate, noted, never a guess. A coupon written with `%` is the percent
it states, and on any other row the coupon is as written.
An account row whose calculation status is Not Available or Not Calculable
has no value, whatever figure it carries. A period's accounting basis and
entity perimeter are read as written, and as not stated where null or where
the run predates those columns.

Pure: no I/O.
