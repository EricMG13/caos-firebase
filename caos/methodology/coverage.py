"""CP-0's page-coverage claims held to the pages the host delivered (D112).

CP-0's P5 row records, per source, the pages its delivered evidence covers.
The host knows that extent exactly: a source delivered `WHOLE` is every stored
block of it, so its last page is the highest page delivered. LCR7's CP-0 wrote
"1-59 shown" for a 67-page credit agreement delivered whole, judged it cut,
and held CP-L10 (N156). An answer whose P5 row gives a whole source a shown
range ending below its last delivered page is refused `HANDOFF_MALFORMED` at
acceptance, and its guided retry is told the source, the pages delivered and
the last heading line delivered.

The reading is bounded and conservative. Only the P5 register's table rows are
read, at most `MAX_P5_LINES` of them; a row is read only when its first cell is
a source id, and a claim only when a whole cell, or one `;`- or sentence-
separated part of it, is a range from page 1 (`Pages 1-67`, `1-59 shown`, `page
anchors 1-6 shown`). A claim the parser cannot read is not a fault, and nor is
a range past the last page (an over-claim holds no consumer back).
