"""One canonical invocation: the host identity from the store, then its prompt (§41).

`host_identity` reads every host-owned fact from what the store pinned -- the
run input's subject and vendor run id, the attempt's stored ordinal, the pinned
route and the accepted upstream artifacts -- so no caller's copy of an identity
survives (invariant 3). `build_handoff_prompt` hands the module those exact
front-matter lines to copy, every delivered authority file whole, the exact
upstream Markdown as context labelled with its edge's `allowed_use`, a register
of each upstream's host-anchored citations (quote existence proven, support left
to CP-5), and every delivered block as evidence. `within_request_ceiling`
bounds the whole encoded request the provider would send, and refuses an
over-ceiling context rather than cut anything out of it (§45).

`canonical.py` calls both for every canonical attempt, before and after the
call, and once under `prospective_identity` before the attempt exists.

# never gave: the request ceiling bounds the sum and names no part, so the
# first wide pathway would refuse CONTEXT_OVER_CEILING with nothing said about
# which section was large. Declared rather than derived from the ceiling, so a
# reader sees the number. The legacy 32 KiB was sized for another model's
# handoffs: the first live Claude Opus 5 answer, CP-0 over a six-line
# document, ran to 36,544 bytes and the next node refused
# UPSTREAM_SECTION_OVER_CEILING before any call (F110). 96 KiB since D83: the
# 52 KiB that followed refused CP-1's real answers, 9 of 11 CZR sets and 6 of 6
# CCL at 50,489-85,559 bytes, so the next node stopped on the section rather
# than the work. The catalog's widest node is CP-5, 16 direct upstreams: 16
# sections at this bound beside its 169,493 bytes of delivered authority encode
# to 1,750,342 bytes, leaving 2,443,962 of the 4 MiB request (D29) for evidence
# and for the upstream citation register, which this figure excludes and which
# is unbounded (it grows with answer size); a request over the ceiling still
# fails closed, typed (the widest-node test in
# `tests/test_handoff_invocation.py`). The bound is on raw bytes and the
# ceiling on the JSON encoding, so a node whose real sections escape heavier and
# still reaches the ceiling fails closed there, typed.

    in its own section named with its digest, `SKILL.md` first; any other
    module's set, or a file that is not UTF-8, refuses
    `AUTHORITY_BYTES_MISMATCH`. `upstream` must be exactly `identity.upstream`
    with bytes that hash to each ref, each labelled with its edge's
    `allowed_use` from `catalog`. `upstream_citations` maps exactly those refs'
    route nodes to their accepted records' anchored citations
    (`ROUTE_IDENTITY_INVALID` otherwise), rendered as a register that is
    context, never evidence; since D106 a record may hold none, every
    citation of its answer unverified, and its section then lists none of
    them as a quote. `upstream_unverified` maps route nodes to their records'
    unverified citations: each a marker names gets a register line saying
    the host located no quote for it (D107).
    CP-0's T8 modules are the pinned route's,
    never a caller's list. Section markers carry a tag derived from every
    section's own bytes, the host-owned front matter included, so neither a
    section's text nor a host-owned field value can reproduce one; the
    evidence, which opens the prompt, carries its own tag, derived from the
    evidence alone (`pack_tag`), so it is one prefix for every call handed
    it (D113). CP-0 also
    receives its host-verified pinned source metadata as context, never as
    evidence; from it CP-0 authors P3 and P5 and restates nothing. Nothing is
    cut or summarised; the caller bounds it with `within_request_ceiling`.
    Evidence carries one header per `(source_id, page, mark)` run of
    `delivered` (ordered by source then block) and nothing per line: the
    citation rule is stated once, in the final check -- each quote an exact
    excerpt of one evidence line, at least eight words or the whole line,
    once on its page, and never host text, which the check says when a
    header carries a mark -- and it is the rule `verify_citations` holds the
    answer to when it is accepted (`EXCERPT`, D105); before it the host held
    answers to the whole line (`WHOLE_LINE`, N28) and before N28 accepted any
    unique run of the page, and a record accepted under either is
    re-anchored by that rule, which it names. `retry_feedback` is non-empty
    only on a node's guided retry (D30, D82): the checks its refused answer
    failed, rendered last and folded into the tag, so a first attempt's bytes
    are exactly what they were and the refused answer could not have known the
    markers around them. `refused_answer`, the stored answer those checks ran
    on (already across `BoundaryText`), rides only with `retry_feedback`, in
    its own sub-section asking for that answer corrected (D104); it is folded
    into the tag too, so no marker it holds can close the block around it.
    `pack_tag` is the evidence's tag, `evidence_tag` over the run's whole pin
