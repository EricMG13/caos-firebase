"""Where the frontier loop meets a real module.

Phase 4 built a loop that asked a `Provider` for an artifact and a charge. Phase 5
built the thing that actually produces one: verified authority, a provider call,
a canonical envelope, citations anchored in the host's token index. This is the
join `test_the_loop_charges_what_the_provider_reported` proves.

The charge is the one the provider reported, never the estimate. They are
different numbers answering different questions: the estimate is what the run set
aside before the call so the ceiling could be checked (invariant 8), and the
charge is what the call cost. A ledger recording the estimate would reconcile
perfectly against itself and tell nobody what was spent.

What is stored as the artifact is the conforming Markdown handoff `execute_handoff`
(`caos/methodology/canonical.py`) produced and its host record, both addressed
by digest -- not the provider's raw body, which was untrusted text the host has
already replaced (invariant 3).
