"""The one verification of an accepted canonical artifact (§42.4, §45.4).

Three readers -- the orchestration proof, the deliverable's payload and the
runtime's accepted read -- each ran their own copy of the same ten steps and
had drifted four ways. Invariants 3, 4 and 11 all pass through these steps, so
a step silently dropped for one caller is a hole in the host's identity,
authority or citation guarantees. `verify_accepted` is the one copy; each
reader is a call site that names only what is genuinely its own:

- `reanchor`: the proof and the freeze hand over the run's pinned live
  evidence, and every recorded quote is located in it again and must land on
  the recorded rectangles; the runtime hands over none (§42.4 -- the
  rectangles are the ones recorded at acceptance).
- `verify_authority`: the proof and the freeze re-read every authority file
  past the per-manifest digest cache; the frontier keeps the cache.
- `refuse`: which code each step answers. The proof says `ORCHESTRATION_*`,
  the deliverable `ARTIFACT_RECORD_MISMATCH`; `None` lets the step's own code
  through (a citation's, in the deliverable). What a reader refuses is what an
  API serves and a test asserts, so no code moves here.

Everything a step refuses is raised outside the handler that saw it, so no
refusal carries vendor or document text in its chain.
