"""The tagged tables an accepted handoff carries, read by the bundle's own reader.

A handoff's machine interface is its `<!-- table-id: x.y -->`-tagged pipe
tables; an untagged table is presentation (the vendor's `cp_tables`). The
Markdown stays the authority and nothing here is stored: a reader derives the
tables from bytes it has already verified, as the bundle's `parse_tables`
reads them, in document order, each cell its exact text as that reader splits
it.

What a figure is, is the bundle's: a cell has a value only where its own
`parse_figure` reads one, so its null vocabulary is null and a separator it will
not guess (`5,2`) is no value. What the figure is worth, is the host's: the same
spelling read again with `Decimal`, never through the vendor's float
(invariant 7), and served in plain notation at the cell's own scale. A figure
whose exact value would not fit the wire's bound has no value; its text stands.

Pure: no I/O. A vendor exception never leaves here, and its message, which can
quote the document, is never read (invariant 2).
