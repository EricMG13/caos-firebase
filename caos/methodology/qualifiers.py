"""A run's pinned command qualifiers: the vendor's run-local inputs above the
evidence (D109, N146).

The vendor resolves a module's run-local inputs from "current command
qualifier > current conversation value > validated matching upstream handoff >
approved live module reference > declared safe module default > MISSING"
(`CANON_SHARED.md`; CP-2G's `SKILL.md` entry protocol), and CP-0 assesses
readiness against "the user's stated objective" (its hard rule 6). This host
has no conversation, so the one channel is the command: a closed map of
module id to qualifier name to one line of text, pinned once in the run input
and fingerprinted with it (invariant 10), and delivered to the named node only
as a host-owned "current command" section.

Closed both ways. A module takes only the names `QUALIFIER_FIELDS` lists; for a
module whose `SKILL.md` declares its stage fields (`ux_stage_fields`), each
listed name must also be one of those, read from the verified bytes at the pin
(invariant 4). CP-0's `objective` is hard rule 6's stated objective.

The owner's rule (D109): when a route carries CP-2G and the pin states no
`forecast_horizon` or `base_period`, the host derives it from the pinned
reporting period (`derived_scope`), writes it into the pin marked `derived`,
and refuses a period the rule cannot read rather than guess. A stated value
always wins. `cases` is never derived.
