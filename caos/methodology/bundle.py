"""The methodology bundle: authority, verified on the bytes at use.

Invariant 4. The bundle is the methodology authority, it is read-only at runtime,
and its integrity is checked *at use* rather than at startup only -- because a
digest verified when the process booted says nothing about the file the process
reads an hour later, and that file is the methodology a credit opinion rests on.

Two rules shape what is here.

*The carve-out.* Upstream merged CP-PARSE into CP-0. The host keeps them as
separate stage-0 nodes because CP-PARSE owns the `document_parse_manifest` over
the host's own already-extracted blocks, which is host territory. `_CARVE_OUTS`
is the host's one declaration, and CP-PARSE receives the whole CP-0 skill.

*The carve-out's consequence, which is easy to miss.* `assemble_authority` must
not slice `SKILL.md` on section markers. The merged skill has dropped
`## CP-PARSE runnable profile`, so a slicer looking for it would break CP-0 as
well as CP-PARSE. The whole file, or a refusal.
