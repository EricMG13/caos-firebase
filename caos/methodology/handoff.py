"""The canonical Markdown handoff: vendor conformance, then host identity (§41).

A module's output is one UTF-8 Markdown file whose SHA-256 is the lineage hash
downstream handoffs name. The vendor's validators decide whether it conforms;
this module decides whether it is *this* invocation's handoff. Every field the
host owns is compared type-exactly against what the host would have written,
because a provider-claimed identity never survives (invariant 3).

Pure: no clock, and no I/O but digest-verified blob reads (`read_record`'s two,
`stored_lineage`'s one per direct upstream record the caller has not verified).
The closed provider transport and the host record beside the Markdown live
here too, so one module owns the handoff's shape end to end. Every refusal is
a typed code raised outside the handler that caught the vendor's exception, so
neither the exception chain nor the refusal carries vendor text, which can
quote the document (invariant 2).

    Both blobs are read, so both digests are proven; the record must parse
    strictly, be in its own canonical form, name this Markdown and carry exactly
    `expected`. Every failure is `ARTIFACT_RECORD_MISMATCH` with no text.

    The record is still not fact (§41.2): re-parsing the projections from the
    Markdown and re-anchoring the citations are the readers' steps (3.1d), since
    they need the vendor contract and the store.
