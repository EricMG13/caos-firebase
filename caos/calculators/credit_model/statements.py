"""The statements over the historical columns: the income statement to
adjusted EBITDAR, the cash flow waterfall, the net cash flow, liquidity, the
debt totals, working capital, and the pro forma LTM.

Outflows are negative in the frame. Each expense or outflow account in
`OUTFLOW_METRICS` is read as minus its absolute value (`account_frame` does
so row by row, before any sum), so a CP-1 run that wrote them positive reads
the same; a signed flow keeps CP-1's sign (cash taxes among them: a positive
one is a refund, CP-1's sign convention, served noted `TAX_REFUND`, where a
model that wrote its outflow positive shows). A line
the host recomputes where CP-1 states its own figure (gross profit, EBIT,
EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA) carries that figure as `stated`, noted where it
differs beyond its rounding. Three lines are residuals the host calculates and
never reads from CP-1: `other_operating` (so FFO plus the working-capital
change is the adjusted CFO), `other_investing_financing` (so the net cash
flow is CP-1's net cash change) and `fx_and_other_cash` (so opening cash plus
the net cash flow reaches closing cash); `debt.py` adds `debt_non_cash`.

The `acct:` keys are CP-1's cells from `account_frame`, outflows already
negative; the lines are the fixed keys (`cogs`, `da`, `capex` ...).

Adjusted CFO moves the lease payments and interest CP-1 classes in financing
into operating cash flow; where CP-1 has no row for either over the column's
periods it counts as zero there and in FFO. An add-back with no row for the
column's periods adds nothing to adjusted EBITDA (its `addback:` cell stays
`NOT_SOURCED`), and a PF adjustment to a facility the LTM has no balance for
adds to nothing. Each such sum, and every figure built from it, is noted
"not stated, treated as zero (<part>)" naming the part. One whose row has no
figure leaves
adjusted EBITDA `COMPONENT_MISSING`. With `exclude_unrealised`, an add-back
with any row `UNREALIZED` or `NOT_STATED` is left out of adjusted EBITDA on
every column (spec M7); CP-1's figure is kept as `stated` and compared only on
a column where nothing was left out (an excluded add-back of zero or none
leaves nothing out).

The PF-LTM shows no KPI, working-capital balance or days ratio
(`NOT_APPLICABLE`), as the worked example does; a PF `ebitda` adjustment
adds to both EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. A PF adjustment is a change, not a
balance, so it keeps CP-1's sign (a refinancing that cuts interest is a
positive adjustment to cash interest); a negative zero reads as zero. A PF
facility adjustment for
a facility the LTM has no balance for adds to zero. The PF-LTM's debt
roll-forward opens at the LTM's opening, keeps its non-cash movements and
closes at the pro forma total debt; its debt raised is `NOT_APPLICABLE` in
this frame, and the layout's roll-forward reads the LTM's
(`rollforward:debt_raised_net`) with the PF rows that enter total debt
beneath, so the laid-out roll-forward foots.

A debt balance that leaves something out (a facility in another currency,
`debt.py`) passes its note to the balances read from it: net debt and the
lease-adjusted debts.

Pure: Decimal only, no I/O, no rounding.
