"""The credit model's lines: every row of the worked layout, in its bands
and order, with one cell per column (spec, layout rule and row economy).

Bands run KPIs, business-unit revenue, gross profit, operating expenses to
EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, the waterfall to free cash flow, the net cash flow
with cash and liquidity, the debt stack by payment rank, the debt
roll-forward, the projections' interest, working capital and the credit
metrics. Every line is emitted, zero or empty ones included: hiding them is
the frontend's job.

A line reads its frame key on each column; a key a column has no cell for is
`NOT_PROJECTED` on a projection, `NOT_APPLICABLE` for a pro forma row or an
interest line elsewhere, else `NOT_SOURCED`. Two kinds of line are the
layout's own: "Less: cash and equivalents" (closing cash negated) and a
payment rank's subtotal, shown only where the rank has more than one facility
in its totals, and, after the ranks and in none, "Unallocated movements
(CP-CF)": a projection's total debt less its scheduled facilities, so the
stack foots on every column. A pro forma row sits under the account it adjusts (a
facility, cash interest, closing cash, the operating lease liabilities),
which on the PF-LTM shows the LTM's unadjusted figure, or above the subtotal
it enters (revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA); a facility the register has
no row for, or a `total_debt` adjustment, sits above total debt. Subtotals
and totals include the PF rows. Where the business units (and revenue PF
rows) do not sum to revenue beyond its rounding, the revenue cell is noted
"business units do not sum to revenue". A `MEMO` line enters no total: the
CFO as reported, an add-back left out by "exclude unrealised", and a
facility in another currency. Operating leases are not facilities in the
stack: their balance is the operating lease liabilities line (a `DEBT
ADJUSTMENT` row is debt however it is classified, `debt.is_operating_lease`).
An add-back's label shows the realisation status "exclude unrealised" reads:
its last row's that is unrealised or not stated, else its last row's. The
roll-forward's debt raised on the PF-LTM is the LTM's, so the PF-LTM's
roll-forward foots to its pro forma closing debt.

Pure: Decimal only, no I/O, no rounding.
