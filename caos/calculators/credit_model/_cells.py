"""What the credit model's modules share: the Decimal context, the notes,
cell arithmetic, where a balance at a date is read, and which periods are on
another footing.

The anchor is the period at the latest end date of a quarter, YTD or FY: an
FY ending then, else a YTD, else a quarter, first in register order. A period
whose accounting basis or entity perimeter differs from the anchor's (each
compared on case and separators; not stated, on either, matches anything) is
on another footing: it enters no other period's figure (CP-1 and CP-MODEL
never combine them), and a balance read for it is only its own. Whatever the
anchor states, no figure combines two periods that both state a basis, or a
perimeter, and differ (`combined_footing`, pairwise).

Pure: Decimal only, no I/O, no rounding.
