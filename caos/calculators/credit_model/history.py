"""The historical columns and the frame of CP-1's figures over them (spec M2).

Columns run quarters, PYTD, YTD, FY, then LTM. Every reported quarter is a
column; where CP-1's period register has no quarter, one is calculated as
H1 - Q1, 9M - H1 or FY - 9M when both periods exist.

The anchor is the latest end date of a quarter, YTD or FY period. At a
fiscal-year end there is no YTD and the LTM is that FY when it is twelve whole
months (a 52- or 53-week year is); a short or long FY (a transition year) or an
undated one is no LTM, its flows `COMPONENT_MISSING` noted "short fiscal year
(id)", "long fiscal year (id)" or `UNSPANNED`. Otherwise the YTD is
the YTD period ending at the anchor, else the anchor year's quarters to date
when every one is a column (a YTD's fiscal quarter is its register label, else,
as CP-1 leaves it null on every period that is not a QUARTER, its whole
months as quarters: 6 months is H1); the PYTD is the prior year's YTD period of the
same fiscal quarter, else (by its dates, its fiscal quarter not required) the
one YTD period of the same whole months starting a year earlier, else
the prior year's same quarters; and the LTM is FY + YTD - PYTD with the FY of
the prior year, the PYTD's, so the months always number twelve. A period is
n whole months when the day after it ends lies within `SLACK_DAYS` (7) days
of its first day plus n months, `WEEK_SLACK_DAYS` (14) where its length is a
whole number of weeks (a 14-week quarter), one n at most; a year earlier is
within `SLACK_DAYS` of twelve months earlier, so 52/53-week calendars
resolve; periods that follow one another meet exactly (end + 1 day = next
start). The dates
leave the PYTD ambiguous where a YTD period ends before the YTD starts, or
has no dates, but not exactly one dated period is that one (or the YTD is
not whole months); without the prior year's quarters either, the LTM's flows
are then `COMPONENT_MISSING`, noted `UNSPANNED`.
CP-1's LTM row ending at the anchor names the LTM column and supplies the
stated figures; one ending later than the anchor keeps its own column,
its flows `COMPONENT_MISSING` with CP-1's figure as `stated` (spec M4: the
host recomputes, it never adopts CP-1's arithmetic).

The LTM's FY must end the day before its YTD starts, its PYTD start with
that FY, and its YTD and PYTD be as many days long within `SLACK_DAYS`;
otherwise its flows are `COMPONENT_MISSING`, noted `UNSPANNED`. The twelve
months ending a quarter are its four quarters only where they tile and,
as one span, are twelve whole months: each part's slack never adds up.

A recurring sparse item's (a lease or interest payment classed in
financing) interim without a row counts as nothing in that LTM only when
the other interim has none either (the LTM is then the FY's); with some of
its FY, YTD and PYTD stated and another without a row, its LTM is
`COMPONENT_MISSING`, noted `PARTLY_STATED`, never a sum over 18 or 6
months, and so are its twelve months ending a quarter with some quarters
stated and another without a row. An add-back is a one-off that CP-1 writes
only for the periods it occurred in: any of these without a row is nothing,
noted `treated_as_zero` with its name. (An FY without a row beside a stated
PYTD inside it already resolves `COMPONENT_MISSING`, noted `UNSPANNED`, by
its cover.)

Every row of an outflow account in `OUTFLOW_METRICS` (cash taxes are signed:
a positive one is a refund) is read as minus its absolute value before
anything is summed, so CP-1 writing a quarter positive
and a year negative reads one way; a cell whose figure came from a row
written positive is noted `SIGN_NORMALISED`, and so is every sum of it.

A flow on a reported column is CP-1's figure. A derived column (a calculated
quarter, a YTD or PYTD built from quarters, the LTM, and a YTD or FY period
that names its component periods) adds and subtracts its components; CP-1's
own figure for that column is kept as `stated` and noted when it differs
beyond its rounding. A period's named components must be distinct periods,
each starting the day after the one before ends, from its start date to its
end date (a period without a start date starts its day count before its
end); otherwise its derived cells are `COMPONENT_MISSING`, noted
`UNSPANNED`. A period with no row is `NOT_SOURCED`, and one whose row
has no figure `NOT_STATED`. A sum with a component that has no figure, or
that is not a period, is `COMPONENT_MISSING`; with no row for any component
it is `NOT_SOURCED`; with rows for only some, `COMPONENT_MISSING`.

A sparse item (an add-back; a lease or interest payment classed in
financing) has rows only for the periods it occurred in, so it resolves
bottom-up: a period's figure is its own row (noted "differs from components"
where its parts disagree beyond its rounding: often an add-back is disclosed
only for a half or a year, so that row is the only figure), else the sum of
its components, or else of its cover: from its start date, the longest other
period starting then and ending within it that has a figure (a half or 9M
before its quarters), else the shortest such period without a row, which is
nothing, repeated from the day after the part taken ends; a part with the
period's own dates gives only its own row. A cover counts only where its
parts tile the period to its end date: a day on which no part starts is a
gap. Over a gap the period's own row stands un-noted, and a period without
a row is `COMPONENT_MISSING`, noted `UNSPANNED` (`NOT_SOURCED` where no part
has a row): a partial sum is never the period's figure. Every part without
a row is `NOT_SOURCED`, and a part with a null figure `COMPONENT_MISSING`.
Each period is resolved once per item, so the work is polynomial in the
periods. Columns then add and subtract these resolved figures (the LTM is
FY + YTD - PYTD of them).

For any other flow, a component that is itself a YTD or FY with components
is their sum, one level deep. A balance is the observation at the column's
end date: the column's own period first, then any period ending that day, in
register order. A RATE KPI, and an account in neither metric list, is shown
only on its own period.

`model_inputs.cp1_registers` refuses a register id written twice for one
period, two periods for one fiscal quarter, YTD or year, a fiscal year
without a four-digit year, a date that is not `YYYY-MM-DD`, more than 200
periods and components nested past four deep or in a cycle, so every key and
period here has one row and every fiscal period one period. Registers built
otherwise never raise here: a date that is not one is no date. Fiscal years
compare as that four-digit year (`FY2025` is `2025`, `FY2024/25` is
`2025`).

A period on another footing than the anchor's (`_cells.off_footing`)
enters no other period's figure, and, without its own row of a sparse item,
has none of it either (never its parts', on the anchor's footing). Whatever
the anchor states, a figure whose periods (a column's own and its terms'; a
period and its components; a sparse period and its parts with a figure;
the four quarters of twelve months) state a basis, or a perimeter, two
ways is `COMPONENT_MISSING`, noted `OTHER_FOOTING` (`combined_footing`).

Pure: Decimal only, no I/O, no rounding.
