"""The projected columns: business-unit revenue, the amortisation schedule,
rate-deck interest and the cash flow, per case and year, chained (spec
M10-M14).

One column per (case, period) of CP-CF's request, Base and Downside only.
The base is the latest labelled historical FY, including an undated one:
if it is short, long or unknown under history's whole-month/slack rules,
every projected figure is COMPONENT_MISSING with the base reason. Structural
NOT_PROJECTED and NOT_APPLICABLE cells remain. No FY retains the existing
LTM/opening fallback. Requests still validate before figures are withheld.
Business-unit revenue is the prior year's (the last historical FY, then the
year before) times one plus its slot's CP-2G growth, noted "growth outside
±100%" where that growth is (the figure kept); a segment in no slot, and
corporate and eliminations, is held flat. Revenue is CP-CF's own (every ratio
and growth reads it), the business units' sum only where CP-CF's request has
no revenue; the layout notes business units that do not sum to it. EBITDA,
capex, taxes, distributions, issuance,
repayments and acquisitions are CP-CF's drivers signed into the frame's
convention (outflows negative); CP-CF's `cfo` is before interest and taxes,
so `other_operating` is `cfo - ebitda`, working capital included.

The schedule opens at the historical column CP-CF's request opens at
(`opening.as_of_period_id`), else the last FY (the host LTM without one):
each facility's `fac:` balance and CP-1's terms there, cash and total debt. An
interest-bearing facility (not a lease, not a `DEBT ADJUSTMENT` row, in the
register's currency) amortises `min(annual_amortisation, balance)` a year,
never below zero; a null amortisation is none, noted. A maturity inside a
projected fiscal year is assumed refinanced: the balance stays, noted.
Finance leases and the debt adjustment are held flat; a facility in another
currency is held flat and left out (spec B13: no FX); operating leases are
not projected. A rate term outside CP-1's value set or its range is never
used: a spread outside 0-2,000 bp or a floor outside 0-1,000 bp, either not a
whole number of basis points (a percent read as basis points), or a fixed
coupon (as `model_inputs` reads it) outside 0-30 percent (from 0, a
zero-coupon convertible; 0.5-30 where read as a fraction), or any term CP-1
wrote so (a spread or floor written with `%`, or a coupon below half a
percent that no text decides, `terms_out_of_range`). The
rate falls back to the implied rate, and a negative amortisation to none,
each noted "term out of range". A `FIXED` coupon `model_inputs` read as a
fraction (`0.065` as 6.5 percent) is priced at the percent read, noted
"coupon read as a fraction"; that note also reaches the year's weighted
rate and cash interest (and so the coverage metrics built on it) where a
drawn, priced facility carries it, and no other facility-rate note does.

Interest is the weighted rate of the interest-bearing facilities, weighted
on their scheduled opening balances, times the interest base: the year's
opening debt from CP-CF's roll-forward less what in it bears no interest
(finance leases, the debt adjustment), so CP-CF's repayments, issuance and
non-cash movements reach it (spec M13): no circularity. It is computed as
`(sum of balance x rate) x base / (sum of balance)`, never through the
rounded weighted rate; a negative base has none, noted "negative interest
base". A
facility's rate is its fixed coupon, the deck's reference rate for the case
and year offset (floor applied) plus its spread, or the implied rate: LTM
cash interest over the average of the LTM's opening and closing total debt
(none, with the opening's note, where the LTM's opening stack is incomplete;
noted "facility history incomplete" where the opening is CP-1's stated
total for that reason, as is a facility priced at it).
The year offset counts from the last historical FY (FY+1 is the year after);
a year past the deck holds its last rate, a year the deck skips the year
before it, each noted, and a reference rate the deck lacks is implied.

The aggregate debt roll-forward is CP-CF's: opening, less the scheduled
amortisation, plus issuance, less optional repayment (`debt_raised_net`),
plus PIK, capitalised interest and FX (`debt_non_cash`; absent is none).
Explicit equity and other investing/financing movements enter NCF; absent
equity retains the historical zero and note. Explicit restricted-cash
transfers adjust cash outside NCF, and carrying-value changes enter only
noncash debt. Secured debt sums the scheduled secured
balances, noted "excludes unallocated CP-CF movements" in a year CP-CF's
total debt moves off the schedule; the revolver's undrawn amount is held at
the opening. A facility in another currency at the opening is noted
"excludes facility in another currency" on the totals it would have entered,
and from total debt on net debt, the roll-forward, the interest base and the
cash interest.

A request without the fields the projection reads (`opening` and its
`as_of_period_id`, the periods' `case`, `period_id`, `fiscal_year` and
`days`, the drivers' `case` and `period_id`) or of another shape is refused,
`HANDOFF_MALFORMED`, and so is a period year outside 1900-2200 or more than
ten years from the base year. A driver of zero is zero, never negative zero.

With OWNED_CASH_DEBT_SERVICE explicitly selected, CP-1 validates the opening
and actual bridge, and a complete public cash-flow recomputation supplies the
aggregate cash/debt contract. No native facility schedule or rate determines
these totals. Instruments, secured debt, rates and RCF liquidity are expressly
unprojected; total debt remains visible as unallocated. Explicit validated
segment levels replace the slot growth for their row.

Pure: Decimal only, no I/O, no rounding.
