"""The assembled credit model and the bridges it must close.

`credit_model` runs the calculator end to end: the historical columns and
CP-1's figures over them, the statements (with "exclude unrealised" on every
frame, the LTM ending each quarter included), the PF-LTM where the register
has adjustments to the LTM, the projections where CP-CF ran, the credit
metrics, then the layout. Columns run quarters, PYTD, YTD, FY, LTM, PF-LTM,
then the Base years and the Downside years (spec M2).

`reconciliation_faults` checks these bridges on the assembled model, by line
and column, on exact Decimal equality (the calculator never rounds):

- `ebitda`: EBIT less D&A (negative) plus the EBITDA PF rows;
- `adjusted_ebitda`: EBITDA plus the add-backs in it and its PF rows;
- `ffo`: adjusted EBITDA, cash interest, cash taxes, other operating items
  and lease cash not in EBITDA;
- `cfo`: FFO plus the working-capital change, as the adjusted CFO;
- `fcf`: the adjusted CFO plus capex;
- `ncf`: FCF, acquisitions, debt and equity raised, dividends and other
  investing and financing;
- `cash`: opening cash plus the net cash flow and FX and other movements;
- `liquidity`: closing cash, its PF rows and the undrawn RCF;
- each rank subtotal: its facilities and their PF rows;
- `total_debt`: every facility in totals, their PF rows, the PF rows for
  debt the stack has no facility for, and the unallocated movements (a
  projection's total debt less its scheduled facilities);
- `debt_rollforward`: opening debt, debt raised, non-cash movements and the
  PF rows in total debt, as closing debt;
- `interest`, on a projection: cash interest as minus the weighted rate
  times the opening interest-bearing debt, to the 38 digits each is computed
  to (interest is computed from the facility weights, never through the
  rounded rate, so the two part only in their last digits).

Selected aggregate projections additionally compare every primary total and
principal component to immutable expectations recomputed from the original
request. Missing/incomplete expectations and numeric instrument, secured,
rate or RCF/liquidity diagnostics fail. Selection is structured metadata,
never inferred from cell notes.

Nothing else is checked: not the CFO as reported (a memo), the income
statement above EBIT, the debt totals net of cash and with leases, working
capital, the interest base, nor revenue against the business units (a noted
limitation, not a fault). A bridge with a line that has no figure on a
column is not checked there, except a line the calculator itself counts as
nothing when absent (an add-back, a pro forma row, lease cash not in
EBITDA, the residual other investing and financing and FX lines a projection
has not, and a facility not in the stack at that date): with reason
`NOT_SOURCED`, `NOT_APPLICABLE` or `NOT_PROJECTED` it adds zero. On the
PF-LTM an account shows the LTM's figure, its PF rows beneath. Each fault
reads `"<column_id>:<bridge>"`.

The limitations count the PF adjustments to a period the model has no PF
column for (CP-1's LTM the grid does not show), name the periods on another
accounting basis or perimeter than the anchor's, or, on one the anchor does
not state, than another period's, which no figure combines
(`_cells.uncombined_periods`), and list
each component of a compound cell note ("a; b") under
its own note, with the columns it is on, and say where the PF register
states both an `ebitda` and an `adjusted_ebitda` adjustment to the PF-LTM (a
PF `ebitda` adjustment already reaches adjusted EBITDA).

Pure: Decimal only, no I/O, no rounding.
