"""The credit metrics on every column: leverage, coverage, cash flow and
liquidity ratios, margins, and growth against the like period a year earlier.

Leverage and coverage are on a 12-month basis: a quarter reads the LTM ending
it (`ltm_ending`, the statements over `ltm_frames`), an FY, LTM, PF-LTM or
projected column itself, and on a PYTD or YTD they are `NOT_APPLICABLE`, as
are the flow-to-debt ratios (FFO and FCF over debt). Liquidity to debt is on
the 12-month basis where there is one, else on the PYTD or YTD itself. A
ratio of two flows of one period (FCF to adjusted EBITDA, capex to revenue
and the margins) is always on the column's own period, quarters included.
On the PF-LTM the reported-EBITDA variants of total and net leverage and of
interest coverage are `NOT_APPLICABLE`: pro forma is on adjusted EBITDA; so
are its EBITDA margins unless a pro forma adjustment reached revenue (its
revenue cell is then `PRO_FORMA`).

Debt and EBITDA are the frame's: the reported variants divide by `ebitda`,
the adjusted by `adjusted_ebitda`, and the lease-adjusted by
`adjusted_ebitdar`. Cash interest, capex and the operating lease cost are
outflows, negative in the frame, so the formulas negate them. A key a
projected column has no cell for (gross profit, the lease cost, EBITDAR) is
`NOT_PROJECTED`, as are the reported EBITDA and the lease balances it carries
so; any other column's missing key is `NOT_SOURCED`.

A metric with an input that has no figure takes that input's reason, the
first in formula order. Projected reported leverage remains `NOT_PROJECTED`
when its reported EBITDA is structurally unprojected, even if debt is missing.
A denominator at or below zero is
`ZERO_OR_NEGATIVE_DENOMINATOR`. A metric with a figure carries what its
inputs leave out ("excludes facility in another currency", "excludes
unallocated CP-CF movements", `debt.carried`), so leverage on debt without a
foreign facility, or projected secured debt without CP-CF's sweeps, says so.
Leverage and coverage are multiples (`x`), the rest decimal fractions shown
as percent (0.08 is 8%).

Growth compares a quarter with the quarter a year earlier, a YTD with the
PYTD, an FY with its preceding fiscal-year label (else the date-window
fallback), and an LTM with the LTM a year earlier (the column of that kind
ending within a week of a year before, for 52- and 53-week years;
for an LTM without one, the LTM ending the quarter that ends then, from
`ltm_ending`), and a projection with its case's prior year, else the
historical FY of that year. FY-vs-FY and projected-FY growth require known
equivalent durations, measured from each column's end date and day count
under history's whole-month/slack rules. Unequal or unknown durations are
COMPONENT_MISSING with a duration note; equal nonannual FYs may compare.
Quarter, YTD and LTM comparisons retain their own window semantics.
Without such a column, and on a PYTD or PF-LTM,
it is `NOT_APPLICABLE`, as is a `bu_growth:` for a corporate or eliminations
segment (`corporate`). Against a prior on another footing it is
`COMPONENT_MISSING`, noted `OTHER_FOOTING`: the prior's footing differs from
the column's or from the anchor's, or either column's own periods differ
(`_cells.Footings`; a column it does not name is not stated).

Pure: Decimal only, no I/O, no rounding.
