"""The debt stack over the historical columns: totals, payment ranks, the
roll-forward and the undrawn revolver.

A column's stack is CP-1's facility rows at its end date: the column's own
period first, then any period ending that day, in register order (the balance
rule `history` reads). Totals use carrying values. `total_debt` is every row
but an `OPERATING_LEASE` (finance leases included), plus a `DEBT ADJUSTMENT`
row however it is classified; `lease_liabilities` is the operating leases.
CP-1's `total_debt` account excludes every lease, so the host's total less its
finance leases is what is compared with it (`stated`). A row in a currency
other than the register's enters no total (spec B13: no FX); its `fac:` cell
keeps its figure, noted, and each total it would have entered, with the
roll-forward line it reads, is noted "excludes facility in another currency".
A `DEBT ADJUSTMENT` row is the one CP-1 writes with
`facility_type` `DEBT ADJUSTMENT` (REF_CP-1_STEPS, debt register; CP-MODEL's
validator reads the same column).

The roll-forward opens at the stack on the day before the column starts (its
end date less its days) and closes at the column's own; `debt_non_cash` is the
residual after the net debt raised in the cash flow statement, noted with
what its closing or opening leaves out. Where the
opening date has facility rows but none for a facility the closing stack
counts in total debt, the opening is `COMPONENT_MISSING`, noted "opening
stack incomplete" (a part-written stack is no opening balance). A facility
whose every row is in a period ending after the opening date is a new issue,
nil at the opening, only where CP-1's `total_debt` stated at the opening date
agrees, within its rounding, with the opening stack less its finance leases
(never a `DEBT ADJUSTMENT` row, which CP-1 counts in total debt however it
is classified, as the closing does);
otherwise CP-1 left out the facility's history, and the opening is that stated
figure plus those finance leases, noted "facility history incomplete" (as is
the residual read from it). Without a stated figure, or with a facility in
another currency left out of the opening (CP-1's figure is then on another
footing), the opening is `COMPONENT_MISSING`, noted the same.

Pure: Decimal only, no I/O, no rounding.
